# Contributing to Tandem

Thanks for your interest in Tandem. This document covers what you need to build, test, and
propose changes.

## Before you start

Tandem is developed spec-first: the [HLD](docs/HLD.md) and the per-module `docs/LLD-*.md`
documents are the source of truth for design decisions. For anything beyond a small fix, please
open an issue to discuss the change before writing code — it avoids wasted work on a design that
doesn't fit the project's principles (per-aggregate ordering, backward/forward compatibility of
every contract, minimal footprint on the client's write path, opt-in complexity for the
non-default cases).

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 17** (the Gradle toolchain plugin auto-provisions it if not already installed).
  `tandem-benchmark` additionally requires JDK 25, provisioned the same way.
- **Docker**, running and reachable — most integration/e2e tests use
  [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) to spin up real PostgreSQL and Kafka instances.
  There are no mocks standing in for the database or the broker in this project.
- **Go 1.25+**, only for [`tandem-cli`](tandem-cli/) — a separate toolchain and build, not part
  of `./gradlew check` (see below).

## Building and testing

```bash
./gradlew check
```

This compiles every module, runs unit tests, and runs the Testcontainers-backed
integration/e2e tests. It's the same command CI runs, so a green `check` locally is the bar for
a pull request.

To also produce the aggregated coverage report CI publishes to Codecov:

```bash
./gradlew check :tandem-coverage:aggregatedCoverageReport
```

`tandem-benchmark` is intentionally excluded from `check` (it's a load-testing harness, not a
published module). Run it explicitly if your change touches the relay's performance
characteristics:

```bash
./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:loadTest
```

The same module also carries a demo that prints the relay's lag gauges (backlog size, backlog age,
live workers) through a build-up, a drain and a steady-load phase. It measures nothing and gates
nothing — it exists so the *shape* of the signal can be judged by looking at it, which a passing
assertion cannot do. Run it when you change what the gauges report or how often they are read
([LLD-benchmark.md](docs/LLD-benchmark.md) §6.2); it takes ~50s and needs Docker:

```bash
./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:lagGaugeDemo
```

Two more demos in the same module hold a live Grafana dashboard open instead of asserting on the
signal in a test. Run `metricsDashboardDemo` when you change what the relay's Micrometer metrics
report ([LLD-benchmark.md](docs/LLD-benchmark.md) §6.3):

```bash
./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:metricsDashboardDemo
```

Run `tracingDashboardDemo` when you change trace propagation or the relay's publish span — it
exports one real trace, write through consume, to a Tempo container read on the same Grafana
([LLD-benchmark.md](docs/LLD-benchmark.md) §6.4):

```bash
./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:tracingDashboardDemo
```

`tandem-cli` is entirely outside the Gradle build (its own `go.mod`, LLD-cli.md §2) — `./gradlew
check` never touches it. Build and test it from `tandem-cli/`:

```bash
cd tandem-cli
make generate   # regenerate internal/client/generated.go after an OpenAPI contract change
make docs       # regenerate docs/cli/*.md after a command/flag/description change
make build
make test       # go test ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic
make lint       # golangci-lint (analysis + formatting), pinned in the Makefile
```

To try `bin/tandem-cli` by hand without a real `tandem-admin` instance, `hack/fake-admin-api.py`
(stdlib-only, no dependencies) fakes just enough of the Admin API contract to exercise every
command:

```bash
python3 tandem-cli/hack/fake-admin-api.py 8080
./tandem-cli/bin/tandem-cli --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 relay status
```

## Project layout

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tandem-bom` | Bill of Materials — version constraints for every published module, no code. |
| `tandem-core` | Ports and domain types — no I/O, no external dependencies. |
| `tandem-jdbc` | Write-side outbox INSERT, relay polling/claiming, PostgreSQL adapter. |
| `tandem-kafka` | CloudEvents publication to Kafka. |
| `tandem-test` | Test helpers (`InMemoryOutbox`, `RecordingDispatcher`, `TandemTestContainer`). |
| `tandem-spring-producer` | Spring Boot autoconfiguration for the write side, plus its usage tiers. Never pulls Kafka. |
| `tandem-spring-relay` | Spring Boot autoconfiguration for the relay, started with the application. |
| `tandem-micrometer` | `TandemMetrics` backed by a Micrometer `MeterRegistry`, autoconfigured by `tandem-spring-relay`. |
| `tandem-tracing-otel` | Trace propagation and relay publish spans over the OpenTelemetry SDK directly, for applications outside Spring. |
| `tandem-admin` | Optional REST Admin API over the outbox and the relay (API-first, off by default). Reads, replay/discard, and relay control (status, pause/resume, per-bucket/per-worker observability, force-release) are all implemented — the contract is fully implemented; see [IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-admin-api.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-admin-api.md). |
| `tandem-sample` | Example application (plain Java), not published. |
| `tandem-sample-spring` | Example Spring Boot application, not published. Also hosts the end-to-end Spring smoke test. |
| `tandem-benchmark` | Load-testing harness, not published. |
| `tandem-coverage` | Aggregates JaCoCo coverage across modules for CI. |
| [`site`](site/) | **Not a Gradle module** — the source of [tandem.codingful.com](https://tandem.codingful.com): the landing page and the dereferenceable RFC 9457 problem-type pages the Admin API's error `type` URLs resolve to. Plain HTML/CSS, assembled by `site/build.sh` and deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`; see [site/README.md](site/README.md). |
| [`tandem-cli`](tandem-cli/) | **Go**, not a Gradle module — a command-line frontend over the Admin API. Its own `go.mod`, own tests (`go test ./...`), own release cadence (`cli-v<semver>`, not the library's `v<semver>`); see [LLD-cli.md](docs/LLD-cli.md). |

The Spring modules are compiled against Spring Boot 3.x with Spring `compileOnly`, and one artifact
serves both Boot 3.x and 4.x; `./gradlew check` runs their tests against both lines. If you change them,
read the dual-generation rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first — breaking them fails silently.

The project follows a hexagonal (ports & adapters) style: `tandem-core` defines the ports,
adapter modules depend on `tandem-core`, never the reverse. See
[docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) for the full architecture.

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change, keeping it scoped — unrelated cleanup makes a PR harder to review.
3. Add or update tests. New behavior needs test coverage; bug fixes should include a test that
   would have caught the bug.
4. If the change affects a documented contract (REST API, DB schema, Kafka message format),
   update the relevant HLD/LLD alongside the code — see
   [docs/HLD.md §1.4](docs/HLD.md) for the compatibility rules any such change must satisfy.
   A **DB schema** change is made in the Liquibase changelog under `schema/postgres/changelog/`,
   never in `schema/postgres/tandem-baseline.sql` — that file is generated
   (`./gradlew generateBaselineSql`) and `check` fails if it drifts. A changeset that has shipped
   is immutable, so append a new one rather than editing it.
5. Run `./gradlew check` locally before opening the PR.
6. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of the change and why it's
   needed.

## Code style

There's no auto-formatter enforced yet; match the style of the surrounding code. Keep comments
to the "why", not the "what" — well-named identifiers should make the "what" obvious.

## Reporting bugs and proposing features

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alirux/tandem/issues). For bugs, include Tandem version,
database/Kafka versions, and a minimal repro if possible. For feature proposals, a short
description of the use case is more useful up front than a full design.
