/**
 * Prints what the relay's lag gauges actually look like over a run, so their shape can be judged
 * rather than merely asserted: a backlog is built with the relay stopped, the relay is then started
 * and drains it, and finally a moderate steady load runs. Each sample shows the relay's own reading
 * ({@code TandemMetrics}) next to {@link LagProbe}'s independent SQL over the same table — two
 * computations of the same figure, which is the point of reading them side by side.
 *
 * <p>Report output, like the rest of this module: {@code System.out}, not a logger.
 *
 * <p>Usage: {@code ./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:lagGaugeDemo}. Needs Docker.
