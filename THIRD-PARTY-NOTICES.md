# Third-Party Notices

Tandem is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

Tandem publishes **standard, non-shaded JARs**: third-party libraries are *not*
bundled into Tandem's artifacts. Consumers resolve them separately from Maven
Central, each under its own license. This file lists the third-party libraries
that reach a consumer's **compile / runtime classpath** when depending on a
Tandem module — it is provided as a convenience, for informational purposes only.

Dependencies used only to build and test Tandem itself (e.g. JUnit, AssertJ,
HikariCP, HdrHistogram, slf4j-simple) are **not** listed: they never reach a
consumer. Note that `tandem-test` is the one published module whose *purpose* is
testing, so the libraries it needs — Testcontainers and the PostgreSQL JDBC
driver among them — do reach whoever declares it, and are listed below.

## Runtime footprint by module

| Module         | Redistributed runtime dependencies                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `tandem-core`  | none — JDK only                                     |
| `tandem-jdbc`  | none beyond `tandem-core`: the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is test-only, and `compileOnly` for the `pg_notify` wakeup adapter, so neither reaches a consumer |
| `tandem-cloudevents` | `cloudevents-core` |
| `tandem-kafka` | `kafka-clients`, `cloudevents-kafka`, `cloudevents-core` (via `tandem-cloudevents`), `slf4j-api` |
| `tandem-rabbitmq` | `amqp-client`, `cloudevents-core` (via `tandem-cloudevents`), `slf4j-api` |
| `tandem-spring-producer` | none beyond `tandem-jdbc` — **Spring and Jackson are `compileOnly`**, so the application's own versions are used and none is dragged in |
| `tandem-spring-relay` | none beyond `tandem-jdbc` — Spring is `compileOnly`, as above, and so are `tandem-kafka` and `tandem-micrometer`: the transport is a port, so the application declares the publish adapter it uses and inherits no other one |
| `tandem-micrometer` | `micrometer-core` |
| `tandem-tracing-otel` | `opentelemetry-api` |
| `tandem-admin` | none beyond `tandem-jdbc` — Spring is `compileOnly`, as above. Of Jackson it compiles against the **annotations only** (`jackson-annotations`, also `compileOnly`), never a JSON binding: Boot 3 supplies Jackson 2 and Boot 4 supplies Jackson 3, and the annotations are what both carry |
| `tandem-test`  | `testcontainers-postgresql`, `testcontainers-kafka`, `kafka-clients`, and the `postgresql` JDBC driver (runtime). Meant for a consumer's **test** scope, but its POM declares them at compile/runtime scope, so they are redistributed like any other dependency. Testcontainers itself brings a substantial transitive tree (docker-java, Jackson, commons-compress, …) not enumerated here |
| `tandem-bom`   | none — a POM with no code, publishing only version constraints |

## Dependencies

The complete set of third-party libraries a consumer may pull onto the
compile / runtime classpath is:

| Library                                 | Version | License      |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients          | 3.9.2   | Apache-2.0   |
| io.cloudevents:cloudevents-kafka        | 4.1.1   | Apache-2.0   |
| io.cloudevents:cloudevents-core         | 4.1.1   | Apache-2.0   |
| com.rabbitmq:amqp-client                | 5.25.0  | Apache-2.0   |
| org.slf4j:slf4j-api                     | 2.0.16  | MIT          |
| org.testcontainers:postgresql           | 1.21.4  | MIT          |
| org.testcontainers:kafka                | 1.21.4  | MIT          |
| org.postgresql:postgresql               | 42.7.12 | BSD-2-Clause |
| io.micrometer:micrometer-core            | 1.13.6  | Apache-2.0   |
| io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api       | 1.38.0  | Apache-2.0   |

`cloudevents-core` is declared directly by `tandem-cloudevents`, and `cloudevents-kafka`
pulls it in transitively as well. The three
entries below `slf4j-api` reach only consumers of `tandem-test`; each Testcontainers
module additionally pulls `org.testcontainers:testcontainers` and its own transitive
dependencies, which are not enumerated here.

## `tandem-cli` (Go binary)

`tandem-cli` is not a JVM module — it is a separately versioned Go binary
(`tandem-cli/`, its own `go.mod`, LLD-cli.md §2/§9.1), so the "reaches a consumer's
classpath" framing above does not apply to it. The equivalent inheritance event is
**static linking**: every dependency below is compiled directly into the distributed
`tandem-cli` binary (Go has no dynamic linking for these), so all of them, not just
direct requires, reach whoever downloads a release. The list is the actual build-info
dependency set of a compiled binary (`go version -m`), not `go.mod`'s full module graph,
which also lists modules only `go generate`'s code-generator tool needs and that never
compile into `tandem-cli` itself.

| Library                                   | Version | License      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| github.com/spf13/cobra                     | 1.10.2  | Apache-2.0   |
| github.com/spf13/pflag                     | 1.0.9   | BSD-3-Clause |
| github.com/inconshreveable/mousetrap       | 1.1.0   | Apache-2.0   |
| github.com/oapi-codegen/runtime            | 1.6.0   | Apache-2.0   |
| github.com/google/uuid                     | 1.6.0   | BSD-3-Clause |
| github.com/apapsch/go-jsonmerge/v2         | 2.0.0   | MIT          |

`mousetrap` links in only on Windows builds (it is cobra's own conditional dependency
for detecting a console-less launch there); the other five link in on every platform
`goreleaser` cross-compiles for (darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64, LLD-cli.md §9).
`oapi-codegen` itself (the code generator) does **not** appear here: it runs at
`go generate` time only, from a separate tools module (`tandem-cli/tools/`) kept apart
specifically so its own, larger dependency tree — and its higher minimum Go version —
never reaches the shipped binary or this table.
