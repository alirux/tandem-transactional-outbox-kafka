 * Optional relay-side span-emission port (LLD-core §2.5, HLD-tracing.md §5–§6, §9's "instrumented
 * mode"). Emits {@code tandem.relay.publish} — one span per outbox record, parented to the
 * {@code traceparent}/{@code tracestate} captured on that record, never a batch-wide span (§6.1). The
 * default is a no-op: {@link #isEnabled()} returns {@code false} and callers guard on it so
 * propagation mode (no relay-side span) costs nothing. A real adapter ships in
 * {@code tandem-spring-relay} / {@code tandem-tracing-otel}.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately explicit parameters, not a generic header map: an adapter is structurally unable to
 * attach the payload or an arbitrary header value to a span, only the identifiers listed here (§6.4).
 * {@code bucket} and {@code partition}/{@code offset} are not included in this first cut — the former
 * is not available at {@link OutboxDispatcher#dispatch}'s call site today, the latter only after the
 * send completes — both are additive to add later.
