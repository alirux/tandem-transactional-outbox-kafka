/**
 * The poll/dispatch/mark logic for one worker (LLD-jdbc §3.3/§3.4), extracted from the threading so it
 * can be unit-tested deterministically against {@code InMemoryOutbox} + {@code RecordingDispatcher}.
 *
 * <p>Per-aggregate ordering and the poison gate hold <b>structurally</b> (§3.4): the head-of-chain
 * claim returns at most one row per aggregate, and {@code seq(N+1)} only becomes claimable once
 * {@code seq(N)} is {@code DONE}. So the worker overlaps {@code batchSize} sends of <i>distinct</i>
 * aggregates on one async dispatcher without any per-record await.
 *
 * <p><b>Completions never touch the database.</b> The dispatcher settles its futures on its own I/O
 * thread (for Kafka, the producer's single sender thread, which every worker's sends share), so the
 * completion handler only enqueues — acks into {@code acked}, failures into {@code failures} — and
 * both queues are drained by the worker's own loop ({@link #flushDone()} / {@link #flushFailures()}),
 * where the JDBC writes happen. A slow store can then never stall the dispatcher's I/O thread and,
 * with it, every other in-flight send. The ordering detector (§3.9) lives on the same side of
 * that line, which is what lets it issue a database lookup and keeps its watermarks unsynchronized.
