-- Schema version v1 — the baseline every Tandem deployment starts from.
--
-- Everything here has shipped and is IMMUTABLE: an operator's DATABASECHANGELOG already records the
-- checksums, so a later schema change appends a new v<n> file instead of editing this one.
--
-- Only text INSIDE a changeset reaches the generated flat baseline, so every section heading and
-- rationale below sits within the changeset it describes rather than between changesets.

--changeset tandem:v1-create-tandem-meta stripComments:false
-- Cross-cutting Tandem metadata, keyed by name (LLD-bucket-count-guard §5). Three keys today:
--   bucket_count  — the single value the write-side and the relay must agree on.
--   relay_paused  — the whole-relay desired state the Admin API writes and every relay instance
--                   re-reads on its control-refresh tick (HLD-admin-api §4.1).
--   coordination  — SINGLE or LEASE, written by the relay at startup so the Admin API knows which
--                   per-bucket endpoints this deployment can actually answer (HLD-admin-api §4.1);
--                   without it the admin would query LEASE-only tables that either do not exist or
--                   are present but unmaintained, and report a healthy relay as stalled.
-- All three live here rather than in dedicated tables because this is the one key/value table
-- present in EVERY deployment — `tandem_bucket_lease` below exists only under LEASE coordination,
-- so a pause stored there could not reach a SINGLE-mode relay. Deliberately NOT seeded here — the
-- guard seeds it on first startup with whatever bucketCount the operator configured, so a fresh
-- database with a non-default bucketCount is correct without editing this file (unlike the lease
-- table below, whose row count must equal B and so is seeded). A database created before this table
-- existed simply has the guard seed the row on first startup under the new version (backward- and
-- forward-compatible, HLD §1.4). `value` is stored as text and parsed by the adapter, so the table
-- is not typed to this one setting.

-- Supports the periodic lease-reclaim (LLD-jdbc §3.5): "status = 1 AND locked_until < now()", run
-- every reclaimInterval (~5s) on every instance. Partial on IN_FLIGHT only, so it stays tiny (in-flight
-- rows are transient and few) and the reclaim scans expired leases, not the whole table — which matters
-- once DONE rows accumulate between cleanup passes on a large, high-throughput outbox.

--changeset tandem:v1-create-index-failed stripComments:false
-- Supports the two metrics-tick readings over FAILED rows (LLD-jdbc §4): `failed.count`, and the
-- `blocked.count` subquery that groups failures by aggregate. Both otherwise seq-scan the whole outbox
-- on every tick, because no other index can answer "status = 3" alone. Partial on FAILED only, so it is
-- normally empty and stays negligible: measured on a 500k-row outbox with three failed rows it was 16 kB
-- against a 47 MB table, and took failed.count from 30.7ms/6075 buffers to 0.06ms/3.
CREATE INDEX idx_tandem_outbox_failed

--changeset tandem:v1-create-index-correlation stripComments:false
-- Supports the Admin API's search by correlation id (HLD-admin-api §4) — the incident-time lookup, where
-- the correlation id is often the ONLY identifier an operator has (it comes from a log line, an alert or a
-- customer ticket; the aggregate id is not known yet). A plain, non-partial B-tree on a real column rather
-- than an expression/GIN index over `headers`: portable to MySQL 8 unchanged, where expression and partial
-- indexes are unavailable and would need a generated-column workaround (LLD-jdbc §5). Non-unique by nature —
-- one correlation id spans many rows, typically across several aggregates (HLD-tracing §2). NULL for every
-- row written with tracing off, and Postgres B-trees do index NULLs, so `(correlation_id) WHERE
-- correlation_id IS NOT NULL` would be smaller — kept non-partial deliberately, for the same MySQL
-- portability reason.

--changeset tandem:v1-create-tandem-bucket-lease stripComments:false
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- LEASE coordination mode only (multi-instance)
--
-- The SINGLE coordination mode (one relay instance owns all buckets in-process) does NOT need
-- these tables. Create them only under LEASE — a horizontally-scaled client with an embedded
-- relay, or one or more standalone relay processes (LLD-jdbc §1/§3.2).
--
-- B (virtual bucket count) is fixed at first deploy and IMMUTABLE thereafter (B5): changing it
-- re-maps aggregates across buckets and would split an aggregate's events across workers. The
-- seed below matches the default B = 256 (buckets 0..255); if you configure a different B, seed
-- exactly that many rows and keep the config and seed in sync.

-- currently owns ZERO buckets has no row in tandem_bucket_lease and would otherwise be invisible to
-- peers' live-owner count, so an incumbent holding every bucket would never learn a newcomer exists and
-- never release its fair share (a stable scale-up starvation). Counting live members here instead makes
-- a zero-owned joiner visible, so the incumbent releases and the fleet rebalances. A dead instance's row
-- simply expires (and is pruned on the next heartbeat). Not seeded — instances self-register at runtime.
