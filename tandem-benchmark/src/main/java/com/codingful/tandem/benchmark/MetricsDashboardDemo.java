/**
 * Drives every meter the relay reports through a real Micrometer → Prometheus → Grafana pipeline, so
 * the signals can be judged on a dashboard instead of in an assertion (LLD-benchmark §6.3). Same
 * intent as {@link LagGaugeDemo} one level up: that one prints two numbers to a terminal, this one
 * shows all twelve on the surface an operator would actually be watching.
 *
 * <p>It <b>measures nothing and gates nothing</b>. The scripted run walks the relay through the states
 * each meter exists to reveal — a backlog with no relay behind it, a drain, steady load, a failing
 * aggregate, a second instance joining, a crash with rows still in flight — and then holds the stack
 * open so the dashboard can be read while it is still live.
 *
 * <p>Report output, like the rest of this module: {@code System.out}, not a logger.
 *
 * <p>Usage: {@code ./gradlew :tandem-benchmark:metricsDashboardDemo}. Add
 * {@code --args="--hold=120"} to close by itself after the given number of seconds instead of waiting
 * on the keyboard. Needs Docker.
