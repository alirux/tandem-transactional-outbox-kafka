# Tandem — `tandem-jdbc` LLD

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)  
**Module:** `tandem-jdbc` · package `com.codingful.tandem.jdbc`  
**Depends on:** `tandem-core` + JDBC (`java.sql`, JDK). **No Kafka** (the relay publishes via the
`OutboxDispatcher` port, implemented by `tandem-kafka`). No metrics library (calls the
`TandemMetrics` port). Minimal client footprint (§1.3).  
**Resolves:** Q8 (bucket model — already decided), Q9 (transaction boundaries), Q10 (batch ordering
on failure), Q11 (head-of-chain / poison), Q12 (cleanup), Q13 (backoff). See [open-questions-lld.md](open-questions-lld.md).

`tandem-jdbc` is the JDBC persistence adapter: the **write-side insert** (used by the client) and
the **relay engine** (poll/publish-coordinate/mark, lease, bucket assignment, cleanup). It
implements `OutboxRepository`, `OutboxStore`, `ReplayService`.

---

## 1. Schema

The `outbox` table is defined in HLD §5.1 (note the `bucket SMALLINT NOT NULL` column). It also
carries a nullable **`correlation_id VARCHAR(255)`** column with a plain B-tree index
(`idx_tandem_outbox_correlation`), written at insert from `headers['correlation-id']` (§2) and
serving the Admin API's incident-time search (HLD-tracing §4.1). A real column rather than an
expression index over the `headers` JSONB, specifically so it ports to MySQL 8 unchanged (§5, where
neither expression nor partial indexes exist); the index is deliberately **not** partial for the same
reason, even though `WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL` would be smaller on PostgreSQL.

The relay adds two tables, used **only under the `LEASE` coordination mode** (§3.2) — i.e. whenever more than
one relay instance runs against the outbox, whether those instances are embedded in a horizontally-
scaled client or standalone processes. Under `SINGLE` (a single relay instance) there are no tables:
the instance owns all buckets in-process.

```sql
-- Bucket ownership under LEASE coordination (§3.2, §4.3). One row per virtual bucket.
CREATE TABLE tandem_bucket_lease (
    bucket       SMALLINT     PRIMARY KEY,   -- 0 .. B-1
    owner        VARCHAR(64),                -- worker id; NULL = free
    lease_until  TIMESTAMPTZ,                -- ownership expiry; renewed on heartbeat
    updated_at   TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
-- Seeded with B rows (0 .. B-1) at setup.

-- Relay-instance presence, decoupled from bucket ownership (§3.2). One row per live instance, renewed
-- each heartbeat; self-registered at runtime (not seeded). Makes a zero-owned joiner visible to peers'
-- fair-share count, so an incumbent holding every bucket rebalances instead of starving the newcomer.
CREATE TABLE tandem_relay_member (
    owner        VARCHAR(64)  PRIMARY KEY,   -- matches tandem_bucket_lease.owner
    lease_until  TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL,      -- presence expiry; renewed on heartbeat
    updated_at   TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

`B` (virtual bucket count, default 256) is **immutable** after first deploy (B5): changing it
re-maps aggregates across buckets and would split an aggregate's events across workers. To change
`B`, drain all PENDING under the old `B` first, then switch.

Because `B` is split across two configured sides (the write-side `JdbcOutboxRepository` and the relay
`RelayConfig`) that are often separate processes, a divergent value would make the write-side insert
into buckets the relay never polls — silently stopping delivery. The **bucket-count guard** persists
the effective `B` in a small metadata table and fails fast on divergence, on both sides:

```sql
-- Cross-cutting metadata, keyed by name. Holds `bucket_count` (the effective B). NOT seeded here:
-- the guard seeds it on first startup with the operator's configured B, so a fresh DB with a
-- non-default B is correct without editing the DDL. A pre-guard database has the row seeded on first
-- startup under the new version (additive, backward/forward compatible — HLD §1.4).
CREATE TABLE tandem_meta (
    key         TEXT         PRIMARY KEY,
    value       TEXT         NOT NULL,
    updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Unlike the two `LEASE` tables, `tandem_meta` is part of the **core** schema (present in every
deployment, both coordination modes) since the write-side relies on it too. Its full design — the
pure `BucketCountReconciliation` strategy and `BucketCountStore` port in `tandem-core`, the
`JdbcBucketCountStore` adapter and `BucketCountGuard` orchestrator in `tandem-jdbc`, the atomic
seed-if-absent and the concurrency handling — is in [LLD-bucket-count-guard.md](LLD-bucket-count-guard.md).
Re-sharding (an intentional change of `B`) is a separate future feature, never something the guard
accepts.

**Bucket computation** (`tandem-jdbc`, at insert): computed **in Java** via the core
`BucketHash.bucketFor(aggregateId, B)` (64-bit FNV-1a + `Math.floorMod`; LLD-core §4) and bound as a
plain `SMALLINT` parameter in the INSERT. It is **engine-independent** (identical on PostgreSQL and
MySQL) and **stable across DB major-version upgrades** — no `hashtextextended`/`CRC32`, no `abs()`
overflow, and the in-memory test adapter computes the same value. The client's `OutboxMessage` never
carries `bucket`.

---

## 2. Write-side — `JdbcOutboxRepository` (implements `OutboxRepository`)

Runs inside the caller's transaction (the client's `@Transactional`); never opens its own.

```sql
INSERT INTO tandem_outbox (aggregate_id, aggregate_type, type, bucket, seq, payload, headers, correlation_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
```
- `bucket` is computed in Java from `aggregate_id` (§1).
- `payload` is the `byte[]` from the `PayloadSerializer` (JSONB for JSON, BYTEA for binary; §5.2 HLD).
- **`contentType`, when set, is merged into `headers["content-type"]`** before the INSERT — the key the
  relay reads for the CloudEvents `datacontenttype` (LLD-kafka §3.2). The typed field is the **single
  source of truth**: if a `content-type` entry is also present in `headers`, the field overrides it. No
  dedicated column (Pareto). (Causation is not handled here — it belongs to the opt-in causal-ordering
  feature, LLD-core §1.3.)
- A `UNIQUE(aggregate_id, seq)` violation is translated to `DuplicateSeqException` (Q5).
- `insertAll` batches multiple messages via JDBC batch in the same transaction.

**A message built with `managedSeq()` uses the same INSERT with the `seq` column left out**
([HLD-managed-seq](HLD-managed-seq.md) §4.1), so the `tandem_seq` default supplies the number:

```sql
INSERT INTO tandem_outbox (aggregate_id, aggregate_type, type, bucket, payload, headers, correlation_id)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
```

Omitting the column *is* the whole mechanism — no extra statement, no round trip, no lock added to
the caller's transaction. Two consequences the adapter carries:

- **The mode is per message, so one `insertAll` can hold both.** They need different column lists and
  therefore different batches, split on **consecutive runs** rather than partitioned by mode:
  grouping all managed messages together would reorder the collection, and every write-side tier
  promises rows land in the order they were collected.
- **A failure on a managed message reports `seq` as `managed`, never a number.** There is none until
  the insert succeeds, and printing `0` or `-1` would send whoever reads the failure looking for a
  row that does not exist.

**A message built with `lockedWrite()` makes `insert`/`insertAll` take `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(aggregate_id))`
on the same connection, right before the row's INSERT** ([HLD-managed-seq](HLD-managed-seq.md) §4.2):

```sql
SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(?));
```

Transaction-scoped — PostgreSQL releases it automatically at commit or rollback, so there is no
corresponding unlock statement. Independent of `seq`/`managedSeq()`: either combines with it or not.
Two consequences the adapter carries:

- **`insertAll` locks every aggregate the batch needs once each, in sorted aggregate id order,
  before inserting anything.** That is the deadlock guard a transaction taking several advisory locks
  needs (two transactions locking the same two aggregates in reverse order deadlock otherwise); within
  one batch the adapter can enforce it, since it sees the whole batch before issuing any statement.
- **It cannot enforce that ordering across separate `insert` calls in one caller transaction.** A
  caller issuing several such calls across aggregates within its own `@Transactional` is responsible
  for the same sorted-order rule itself.

**Optional Lamport advance — RESERVED, not implemented** ([HLD-causal-ordering.md](HLD-causal-ordering.md) §0;
§3.1). No `tandem_aggregate_clock` table and no `lamport` column exist in the shipped DDL, and
`JdbcOutboxRepository` contains none of the code below. It is specified here so that building the
feature is an additive change. Were it built: before the outbox
INSERT, advance the per-aggregate clock with an atomic upsert and write the result to
`outbox.lamport` — all in the same domain transaction. The `tandem_aggregate_clock` row lock
serializes the advance regardless of the client's locking strategy:
```sql
INSERT INTO tandem_aggregate_clock (aggregate_id, lamport)
VALUES (?, GREATEST(0, ?) + 1)
ON CONFLICT (aggregate_id) DO UPDATE SET lamport = GREATEST(tandem_aggregate_clock.lamport, ?) + 1
RETURNING lamport;
```
`:inbound` is the `CausalContext` inbound timestamp (0 if none). When the feature is **off**,
this step is skipped entirely (no `tandem_aggregate_clock` table, no upsert) — zero cost (§1.3).

**Optional trace/correlation capture (only when tracing is enabled, HLD-tracing.md §5, §9).** After
the `contentType` merge, `insert`/`insertAll` call `TracePropagator.capture()` and merge the result
into `headers` for any key **not already present** — an explicit header the caller set (e.g. a
hand-set `correlation-id`) is never overwritten by captured context. Guarded by
`TracePropagator.isEnabled()`: when disabled (the default `TracePropagator.NOOP`, wired by the 2-arg
constructor), no context lookup happens and no map is built (§7 cost table). A manually-assembled
repository passes a real propagator to the 3-arg constructor; real adapters ship in
`tandem-spring-producer` / `tandem-tracing-otel`.

**The `correlation_id` column is filled from the headers just computed**, never from a separate
source — so the indexed copy and the header that reaches Kafka can never disagree (HLD-tracing §4.1).
The value is **truncated** to `MAX_CORRELATION_ID_LENGTH` (255, the column width) rather than
rejected: it normally originates outside the application (an inbound HTTP header, a consumed
message), so it is untrusted input, and an over-long value must not fail the caller's *business*
transaction — the insert shares it. The `headers` copy keeps the full value; it is not indexed. The
column stays `NULL` when no correlation id is present, which is every row when tracing is off.

---

## 3. Relay engine

### 3.1 Worker model & lifecycle

- A **WorkerPool** of `workersPerInstance` threads (default `cores × 2`). Each worker owns a subset
  of buckets and runs the poll loop. The loop **claims and dispatches back-to-back while work
  remains**, re-claiming as in-flight slots free (§3.4); `pollInterval` (default 100 ms) is the
  **idle backoff** applied *only* when a claim returns no rows — it is **not** a per-batch sleep. A
  fixed per-cycle sleep would cap a shard at `batch_size / pollInterval` (e.g. 1 000/s), an order of
  magnitude under the throughput target (HLD §10); the continuous claim-while-busy loop removes that
  ceiling.
- **The idle sleep carries ±20% jitter** (`PollBackoff`). The mean is exactly `pollInterval`, so
  discovery latency is what the operator configured (dispatch-latency.md §1); the jitter only stops
  workers that started in the same instant from polling in lockstep for the life of the relay,
  which would concentrate `instances × workersPerInstance` queries into periodic bursts. The narrow
  band is deliberate: an idle wait must never collapse towards zero and turn the loop into a spin.
- **A cycle that *throws* backs off exponentially instead**, from `pollInterval`, doubling, capped
  at `reclaimInterval` (5 s by default) and reset by the first cycle that completes. This is a
  per-worker counter held in the loop's own frame — never shared state. Under a database outage the
  fixed `pollInterval` retry meant every worker re-querying and logging a stack trace ten times a
  second, turning an outage into a log flood on top of itself; recovery stays bounded by
  `reclaimInterval`, the cadence the relay already uses for its own coordination work, so this
  introduces **no new configuration knob** (HLD §1.1). The cap is a hard ceiling — jitter is applied
  before the clamp, so a saturated worker waits within 20% *below* it, never past it.
- **Supervised threads (coverage must not be silently lost).** Each worker's poll loop runs inside a
  `try/catch` that never lets an uncaught exception kill the thread silently: a per-iteration error is
  logged and the loop continues (after a short idle backoff); a fatal/unexpected death **restarts the
  worker thread** so its buckets are not abandoned. This matters most under the **`SINGLE`** coordination
  mode (§3.2), which has no `tandem_bucket_lease` table to self-heal — a worker thread that died without
  restart would leave its buckets permanently uncovered, visible only as rising `lag.age_seconds`. (Under
  **`LEASE`** a dead *instance* still self-heals via lease expiry, §3.2; the `bucket.uncovered` metric is
  derived from `tandem_bucket_lease` and so reports coverage only under `LEASE` — under `SINGLE`,
  supervised restart is what keeps coverage, and lag age is the backstop signal. Note the two are
  independent recovery layers: within an instance, supervised restart covers a dead *thread*; across
  instances, `LEASE` covers a dead *instance*.) If a worker cannot be restarted, the pool escalates by
  failing the process rather than running with a coverage gap.
- **Graceful shutdown:** stop polling, let in-flight publishes finish (or let their row lease expire),
  release owned buckets (`LEASE` mode; no-op under `SINGLE`), then close. In-flight rows left
  `IN_FLIGHT` are recovered by the lease reclaim (§3.5) — no event is lost.
- **Connections:** plain pooled connections (HikariCP or the app's `DataSource`). **No dedicated/affined
  connection** is required (the bucket-lease design removed the advisory-lock connection-affinity of the
  rejected claim model).
- **Admin-API pause (HLD-admin-api §4.1) is a cached read, never a hot-path query.** A `RelayControlSource`
  refreshes the desired whole-relay/per-bucket pause state on the same maintenance cadence as
  `heartbeatTick`/`reclaimTick` (`reclaimInterval`, 5 s by default); `sliceFor()` consults the cached
  result on every claim, so pause support costs nothing beyond that one periodic query — the claim loop
  itself (§3.1, continuous while busy) never touches the database for it. `RelayControlSource.NOOP`
  keeps this a no-op where no `DataSource` is available (the basic-round convenience constructor).
- **The same tick also heartbeats, for `RelayStatus.state == DOWN` (HLD-admin-api §4.1).**
  `controlTick` calls `RelayControlSource.heartbeat()` right after `refresh()` — one more UPDATE of
  a single already-written row (`tandem_meta.coordination.updated_at`), same cadence, same
  connection cost class. Unlike `refresh()`'s pause state, this is unconditional on coordination
  mode: `SINGLE` heartbeats exactly like `LEASE` does, closing the gap where only `LEASE`'s
  `tandem_relay_member` gave an admin any liveness signal at all. `JdbcRelayControlSource` also
  publishes its own cadence once at `onStart()` (`relay_heartbeat_interval_seconds`), so the admin
  can compute a staleness threshold instead of guessing one.

### 3.2 Bucket assignment — the coordination mode

Bucket ownership is chosen by the **coordination mode** (`RelayConfig.coordination`, HLD §3.2 axis 2),
a **statically declared** option — `SINGLE` (default) or `LEASE`. It is orthogonal to *where* the relay
runs: `LEASE` is used both by a horizontally-scaled client with an embedded relay and by standalone
relay processes. A `BucketSource` abstracts the two so the `WorkerPool` is mode-agnostic:

```java
interface BucketSource {
    Set<Integer> ownedBuckets();          // this instance's currently-owned buckets
    default void heartbeat() {}            // renew/reconcile leases (no-op under SINGLE)
    default void release() {}              // release on shutdown (no-op under SINGLE)
    default OptionalInt uncoveredBuckets() { return OptionalInt.empty(); }  // bucket.uncovered (§4);
                                                                             // empty under SINGLE
}
```

- **`SINGLE` (single relay instance):** `BucketSource.embedded(B)` returns **all** `B` buckets; the
  `WorkerPool` splits them across its worker threads (`bucket % workerCount`). No table, no coordination,
  all-or-nothing coverage (process liveness). `heartbeat`/`release` are no-ops. **Correct only when
  exactly one relay instance runs against the outbox** — running several `SINGLE` instances does not
  corrupt data (ordering + single-claim are row-carried, §3.3) but makes every instance poll every
  bucket, so use `LEASE` instead whenever more than one instance runs.
- **`LEASE` (any number of instances):** `BucketLeaseManager` (a `BucketSource` backed by a
  `DataSource`) partitions the `B` buckets across live instances via the `tandem_bucket_lease` table.
  Each instance, on a heartbeat tick (`reclaimInterval`):
  1. **Register presence:** upsert its liveness into `tandem_relay_member`
     (`INSERT ... (owner, lease_until) VALUES (:me, now() + :lease) ON CONFLICT (owner) DO UPDATE SET lease_until = ...`),
     then **prune** expired members (`DELETE FROM tandem_relay_member WHERE lease_until < now() RETURNING owner`),
     logging the pruned owner id(s) at `WARNING` — the earliest point a survivor's heartbeat can tell a
     peer is gone, ahead of its buckets actually being reclaimed (step 4).
  2. **Renew** its owned buckets: `UPDATE tandem_bucket_lease SET lease_until = now() + :lease, updated_at = now() WHERE owner = :me;`
  3. **Compute fair share** `target = ceil(B / live_members)`, where `live_members` = `count(*)` of
     `tandem_relay_member` rows with `lease_until > now()` (includes self, just registered).
  4. **Reconcile:** if it owns more than `target`, **release** the excess
     (`UPDATE tandem_bucket_lease SET owner = NULL, lease_until = NULL WHERE bucket = ANY(:excess) AND owner = :me`);
     if fewer, **claim** free/expired buckets up to `target`:
     ```sql
     UPDATE tandem_bucket_lease
        SET owner = :me, lease_until = now() + :lease, updated_at = now()
      WHERE bucket IN ( SELECT bucket FROM tandem_bucket_lease
                         WHERE owner IS NULL OR lease_until < now()
                         ORDER BY bucket LIMIT :deficit
                         FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED );
     ```
  Within an instance, its owned buckets are still split across worker threads (`bucket % workerCount`).
  This decentralized greedy + lease converges to a fair, self-healing assignment with no central
  coordinator and no rebalance protocol. A dead instance's leases expire → its buckets are reclaimed;
  its presence row expires too and is pruned. On graceful shutdown an instance releases its buckets
  **and** deletes its presence row, so peers rebalance immediately rather than waiting for expiry.
  Ownership is queryable (the Admin API reads `tandem_bucket_lease` for relay status / `bucket.uncovered`).
  **Every actual ownership change logs at `INFO`** — a claim, an excess release, or a full release on
  shutdown — naming which buckets moved (`UPDATE ... RETURNING bucket`), not just a count; a single-instance
  startup claiming hundreds of buckets at once is logged as a count only (`buckets:` is added only up to
  20 entries) so one coordination event does not become one unreadable line. A heartbeat tick that changes
  nothing (`owned == target`) logs nothing — this is a low-frequency coordination-event log, not a
  per-cycle one (AGENTS.md logging §4). This is what lets an operator see, from the log alone, that a
  bucket the Admin API force-released (`RelayAdminService`, HLD-admin-api §3) was picked back up by a
  live instance on its next heartbeat. The `WARNING` presence-prune log (step 1) and the `INFO` claim log
  (step 4) together tell the causal story of a crash — peer died, buckets freed, buckets claimed — as two
  distinct, correlatable lines rather than a claim with no visible cause.

  > **Why presence is decoupled from ownership (the fair-share divisor counts `tandem_relay_member`,
  > not bucket owners).** If `live` were derived from bucket ownership, an instance that currently owns
  > **zero** buckets would have no `tandem_bucket_lease` row and be **invisible** to peers. An incumbent
  > holding all `B` buckets would then always compute `live = 1`, never release, while a newcomer's claim
  > finds every bucket under a valid, continuously-renewed lease and matches nothing — a **stable

  > was surfaced by the S8 load test (LLD-benchmark §8.2). Counting **members** makes a zero-owned joiner
  > visible, so the incumbent sees `live = 2`, releases its excess, and the fleet rebalances to `B/2` each.
  > `SINGLE` is unaffected (no tables, no heartbeat). The transient during a rebalance — released-not-yet-
  > reclaimed buckets briefly free — is a short lag blip, never loss or reorder (row-carried, §3.3).

  **`LEASE` prerequisites (relay startup fail-fast, §3.5):**
  - The `tandem_bucket_lease` table exists and is **seeded with `B` rows**, and `tandem_relay_member`
    exists (baseline DDL, §1/§6). The relay verifies the lease-table row-count `= bucketCount` and probes
    the member table at startup, fail-fasting otherwise (a common misconfiguration is enabling `LEASE`
    against a DB where only `tandem_outbox` was applied).
  - A **unique `instanceId`** per instance (the lease `owner`, ≤ 64 chars). If unset it is derived as
    `host-pid-<rand>` (stable for the process lifetime); an accidental duplicate would let two instances
    share leases — still safe (row-carried exclusivity) but defeats partitioning, so uniqueness is a
    documented operator invariant.
  - **`bucketCount` identical across all instances** — it is baked into every row's `bucket` (B5) and
    into the lease table's seeded row set; a mismatch is an operator error.
  - **`bucketLease` duration** (the ownership lease, default 30s) is **independent** of `rowLease` (the
    per-row IN_FLIGHT lease, §3.5) — do not conflate them.

  > A brief membership-change window can leave two instances transiently believing they own a bucket.
  > This is **safe** — head-of-chain + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (§3.3) prevent concurrent processing of
  > the same aggregate; the worst case is a duplicate, absorbed by consumer dedup (q8-worker-model-decision §4.2).

### 3.3 Poll & claim (`OutboxStore.claimBatch`) — Q9 tx1, Q11, E2

One transaction: select the **head of each aggregate's pending chain** in the worker's buckets and
mark it `IN_FLIGHT`. The head-of-chain predicate subsumes the poison gate and prevents backoff
leapfrog (E2).

```sql
-- tx1 (claim): runs in its own short transaction, then COMMIT
WITH claimed AS (
  SELECT o.id
    FROM tandem_outbox o
   WHERE o.bucket IN (:my_buckets)
     AND o.status = 0                                   -- PENDING
     AND (o.next_attempt_at IS NULL OR o.next_attempt_at <= now())
     AND NOT EXISTS (                                   -- only the earliest unfinished row per aggregate
         SELECT 1 FROM tandem_outbox e
          WHERE e.aggregate_id = o.aggregate_id
            AND e.id < o.id
            AND e.status IN (0, 1, 3) )                 -- PENDING / IN_FLIGHT / FAILED
   ORDER BY o.id
   FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
   LIMIT :batch_size
)
UPDATE tandem_outbox o
   SET status = 1, locked_by = :me, locked_until = now() + :row_lease
  FROM claimed c
 WHERE o.id = c.id
RETURNING o.*;                                          -- the claimed OutboxRecords
```
- `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` guards the brief membership-change window (§3.2).
- The `idx_tandem_outbox_dispatch (bucket, id) WHERE status=0` index drives the scan; the `NOT EXISTS` uses
  `idx_tandem_outbox_aggregate (aggregate_id, id) WHERE status IN (0,1,3)`.
- **Each claimed row is the head of a _distinct_ aggregate** — the `NOT EXISTS` excludes any aggregate
  that has an earlier unfinished row, so a batch is up to `batch_size` distinct aggregates. These are
  independent and are dispatched with **overlapping in-flight sends** in §3.4; `batch_size` is therefore
  the per-shard concurrency window, not just a fetch size.
- **Commit immediately** — the row lock is held only for this short tx; exclusivity during publish is
  carried by `status = IN_FLIGHT` + the `locked_until` lease, **not** an open transaction (Q9).

### 3.4 Publish & mark (Q9 tx2, Q10/E6) — driven by the relay loop

Because the claim (§3.3) returns the **head of each aggregate** — at most one row per aggregate — a
batch is a set of **independent rows of distinct aggregates**. The relay **dispatches the whole batch
with overlapping in-flight sends** on the single async producer (`dispatch` returns a future,
LLD-kafka §2), up to `batch_size` in flight. It does **not** publish one row at a time:

```
doneIds = concurrent collector
for row in batch:                              # distinct aggregates → independent
    dispatcher.dispatch(row)                   # async; future completes on ack (LLD-kafka §2)
        .whenComplete((ok, err) -> {
            if err == null: doneIds.add(row.id)               # success → DONE (batched, §3.4.1)
                            metrics.recordPublishLatency(now() - row.createdAt())   # §4, HLD §7
            else:           store.markForRetryOrFailed(row, err)   # §3.4.2; this aggregate stops
            freeInFlightSlot()                                 # lets the loop claim more (§3.1)
        })
# flush periodically (every N ids / few ms), not once per row:
store.markDoneBatch(drain(doneIds))            # tx2
```

The latency sample is taken **on the completion handler, at the ack instant** — `RelayWorker` carries
a `Clock` for exactly this (and nothing else: retry backoff still stays relative, anchored on the DB
clock, §3.2/§3.6, never on this one). `now()` is the *relay's* clock, `row.createdAt()` is the
*database's*, so the reading also carries a `created_at`-at-`INSERT`-not-`COMMIT` bias and a DB/relay
clock-skew offset — both documented as caveats on the port method, not hidden (§4).

Per-aggregate ordering and the poison gate hold **structurally**, not via an inner await-loop:

- **One row in flight per aggregate.** The head-of-chain claim already guarantees a batch holds at
  most one row per aggregate; the successor `seq(N+1)` only *becomes* a claimable head once `seq(N)`
  is `DONE`. So `seq(N+1)` is never even claimed — let alone sent — before `seq(N)`'s ack (E6). No
  per-record await is needed in the relay.
- **Stop on failure (E2/Q10).** A failed row goes to retry/`FAILED` (§3.4.2) and stays non-DONE, so
  the aggregate's later rows remain blocked by the head-of-chain predicate next cycle — the aggregate
  stops with no explicit `break`, and the worker keeps its bucket ownership throughout.

**3.4.1 `markDoneBatch` (Q9 tx2 — acked ids across aggregates):**
```sql
UPDATE tandem_outbox SET status = 2 WHERE id = ANY(:done_ids);   -- DONE
```
`:done_ids` accumulates **acked ids across different aggregates** (mark-DONE is order-independent), so
batching is safe and cuts DB round-trips at high rates. A crash before the flush re-publishes those
rows (duplicate, dedup'd) — never a reorder.

**3.4.2 `markForRetry` / `markFailed`:**
```sql
-- retry (attempts < max): back to PENDING with backoff
UPDATE tandem_outbox
   SET status = 0, attempts = attempts + 1, last_error = :err,
       next_attempt_at = now() + :backoff, locked_by = NULL, locked_until = NULL
 WHERE id = :id;
-- exhausted: FAILED (blocks the aggregate via head-of-chain until replay/discard)
UPDATE tandem_outbox
   SET status = 3, attempts = attempts + 1, last_error = :err, locked_by = NULL, locked_until = NULL
 WHERE id = :id;
```
The classification *retriable vs non-retriable* of the dispatch error is a `tandem-kafka` concern (Q17);
`tandem-jdbc` just records the outcome.

### 3.5 Lease reclaim (`reclaimExpiredLeases`) — failover

A periodic job (every ~5 s) resets `IN_FLIGHT` rows whose lease expired (worker crash) and
**counts the reclaim as an attempt** so a row that repeatedly kills its worker cannot loop forever:
```sql
UPDATE tandem_outbox
   SET attempts = attempts + 1,
       last_error = 'lease expired (worker crash or stall) before ack',
       status = CASE WHEN attempts + 1 >= :max_attempts THEN 3   -- FAILED (quarantine)
                     ELSE 0 END,                                  -- else back to PENDING
       locked_by = NULL, locked_until = NULL
 WHERE status = 1 AND locked_until < now();
```
This runs every `reclaimInterval` (~5s) on every instance, so it is backed by the partial index
`idx_tandem_outbox_inflight (locked_until) WHERE status = 1` — tiny (IN_FLIGHT rows are few and
transient) so the reclaim scans expired leases, not the whole table once `DONE` rows accumulate between
cleanup passes.

The reclaimed rows are re-polled (duplicate-safe). **Why increment `attempts`:** a dispatch failure
already bumps `attempts` (§3.4.2), but a worker that dies *before* the send completes (e.g. OOM on a
pathological row) leaves the row `IN_FLIGHT` without ever recording a failure. Counting each reclaim
as an attempt routes such a **crash-poison** row to `FAILED` at `maxAttempts` instead of looping
indefinitely. This is safe because the hard invariant `rowLease > delivery.timeout.ms` (below) means a
lease cannot expire while a send is merely *slow* — an expired lease genuinely indicates a dead/stalled
worker, not a healthy in-flight publish.

**Lease vs producer timeout — a hard invariant.** A row stays `IN_FLIGHT` for the whole publish, so its
lease must outlast the producer's own retry window; otherwise the reclaim resets a row whose send is
still in progress and another worker re-publishes it (duplicates). With the async model an aggregate has
exactly **one row in flight**, so its max publish time is the producer's `delivery.timeout.ms`. Hence:

```
rowLease > delivery.timeout.ms        (defaults 60 s > 30 s; recommended rowLease ≥ 2 × delivery.timeout.ms)
```

**Fail-fast at relay startup (enforced, not just documented).** Before the WorkerPool starts, the relay
reads the effective producer `delivery.timeout.ms` and validates the invariant. If
`rowLease ≤ delivery.timeout.ms` it **aborts startup**, and **all three diagnostics carry the formula and
the offending values** (consistent with the producer-config fail-fast, LLD-kafka §1). One canonical
message string is reused verbatim by the exception and the log:

> Unsafe relay config: rowLease (={rowLeaseMs} ms) must be > Kafka producer delivery.timeout.ms
> (={deliveryTimeoutMs} ms). When rowLease ≤ delivery.timeout.ms, a row's lease can expire while its
> publish is still in progress, so lease-reclaim resets it to PENDING and another worker re-publishes it
> → duplicate events. Required: **rowLease > delivery.timeout.ms** (recommended rowLease ≥ 2 ×
> delivery.timeout.ms = {recommendedMinRowLeaseMs} ms). Fix: raise `tandem.relay.row-lease` above
> delivery.timeout.ms, or lower the producer `delivery.timeout.ms` below rowLease.

- **Exception** — `TandemConfigurationException` with the canonical message above (placeholders filled).
- **Log** — one `ERROR` line with the same text, plus structured fields `rowLeaseMs`,
  `deliveryTimeoutMs`, `recommendedMinRowLeaseMs` (= `2 × deliveryTimeoutMs`) so it is greppable/alertable.
- **Metric** — `metrics.recordConfigInvalid("row_lease_not_above_delivery_timeout")` (→ gauge
  `tandem.relay.config.invalid{check="row_lease_not_above_delivery_timeout"} = 1`), emitted **before** the
  throw. It is best-effort because startup aborts (push registries capture it; a scrape registry may miss
  it) — the exception and log are authoritative; the metric's documented meaning is the same
  `rowLease > delivery.timeout.ms` rule (HLD §7).

### 3.6 Backoff (`BackoffStrategy`) — Q13

Default: **exponential with full jitter**, `delay = random(0, min(cap, base * 2^attempts))`, `base = 1 s`,
`cap` large (e.g. 5 min), `maxAttempts = 10`. Pluggable. Computed in Java; `next_attempt_at = now() +
delay` uses the **DB clock** consistently.

### 3.7 Cleanup (`cleanup`) — Q12

Default: periodic **batch `DELETE`** of terminal rows older than the retention window (default 14 days),
in chunks to avoid long locks:
```sql
DELETE FROM tandem_outbox
 WHERE id IN ( SELECT id FROM tandem_outbox
                WHERE status IN (2, 4)              -- DONE / DISCARDED
                  AND created_at < :doneBefore        -- relay-computed cutoff, see below
                ORDER BY id LIMIT :chunk );
```
Unlike every lease deadline (§3.2), the cutoff is the one timestamp computed on the **relay**
(`clock.instant() - retention`, hence the injectable `Clock` on `WorkerPool`) rather than with the DB's
`now()`. This is deliberate: it keeps the retention window testable with a controllable clock, and a
relay-to-DB clock offset only shifts *when* terminal rows are deleted — over a window of days, never
what gets delivered. Do not copy this pattern for anything that gates delivery.
**Time-partitioning** on `created_at` (drop old partitions) is an opt-in alternative for high volume
(instant drop, no bloat) at the cost of partition-management setup.

**Not bucket-scoped or coordinated across instances.** Unlike claim (§3.3, bucket-partitioned) or lease
renewal (§3.2, `LEASE`-partitioned), `cleanup` runs against the **whole** `tandem_outbox` table using the
same global predicate, and every `WorkerPool` instance schedules its own `cleanupTick` independently —
regardless of `coordination` mode (`SINGLE` or `LEASE`). With N instances, all N run the same `DELETE`
on the same candidate window every `cleanupInterval`. This is **safe**: the statement deletes by `id`, so
a second instance's `DELETE` on ids another instance already removed simply affects zero rows (no error,
no double-delete). It is **redundant** (N instances doing the same scan/delete instead of one), currently
accepted rather than fixed — same pattern as `reclaimExpiredLeases` (§3.5), which is also global and
per-instance. **Possible optimization (not implemented, left for later):** either (a) scope cleanup to
each instance's currently-owned buckets (`bucket_id` predicate via `BucketSource.ownedBuckets()`, cheap
under `LEASE` since ownership already partitions the fleet, no-op benefit under `SINGLE`), or (b) elect a
single cleanup runner — e.g. the `LEASE` member with the lowest `owner` id, or a dedicated
`tandem_relay_lock`-style advisory lock — so only one instance deletes per tick. (a) is simpler and reuses
existing partitioning; (b) fully eliminates the redundant scan but adds a new coordination primitive for a
job that is cheap and infrequent (15 min default) — likely not worth it unless the redundant `DELETE` scan
itself becomes measurably expensive at scale.

### 3.8 In-process status (`WorkerPool.status()`)

A read-only snapshot of the pool's own state — `RelayStatus`: `instanceId`, lifecycle `state`
(`STOPPED`/`RUNNING`/`STOPPING`), `coordination`, `workersConfigured`/`workersAlive`, and
`oldestWorkerCycle` (the least-recently-progressed live worker's last completed claim cycle). What an
embedding application's own readiness/liveness probe reads — Tandem draws no health verdict from it
(no threshold, no DOWN/UP), the same reasoning as shipping no logging configuration (AGENTS.md's
Logging section) or metrics export config: deciding what an acceptable worker deficit or cycle age is
stays the application's call.

**Never queries the database.** This is the contract, not an incidental property — it is what makes
`status()` safe to call at probe frequency (every few seconds, on every instance) at zero cost.
Backlog size/age, failed and blocked counts are deliberately absent for the same reason they are not
folded in here: they are already reachable through `OutboxStore.lag()`/`failedCount()`/`blockedCount()`,
where the caller controls query cadence and caching. Bucket ownership and coverage are absent because
under `LEASE` both are lease-table queries (`BucketLeaseManager.ownedBuckets()`/`uncoveredBuckets()`,
§3.2) — reading them at probe frequency would turn a liveness check into load on `tandem_bucket_lease`.

**`oldestWorkerCycle`, not just `workersAlive`.** A live `Thread` is not a working one — a worker
blocked inside a JDBC call that never returns stays `Thread.isAlive() == true` forever, which
`workersAlive` alone cannot distinguish from a healthy idle worker. Each worker stamps a per-index
`AtomicLongArray` entry with the current instant immediately after a claim-cycle **completes without
throwing** (`WorkerPool.runWorker`) — claiming zero rows still counts as progress (an idle relay is a
working relay); an iteration that throws before completing does not advance the stamp, so a worker
stuck failing every cycle shows an ageing timestamp instead of a fresh one. Starting a worker thread
stamps its entry immediately, before the thread runs its first cycle, so a worker that hangs on its
very first claim reports an ageing timestamp from start time rather than an absent one.
`workersConfigured` vs. `workersAlive` is the other half of the picture: the gap matters more than
either absolute number, since a died thread is restarted automatically (§3.1) and a transient deficit
during that restart is normal — a persistent one is a worker dying in a loop.

### 3.9 Write-side ordering detection (`PublishOrderWatermarks`)

HLD §4.2 makes "writers to one aggregate are serialised" a precondition Tandem depends on and cannot
enforce. When it is violated the relay publishes an aggregate's events out of the order they were
meant to go in, and this is where that becomes visible — the only place it ever is.

**Which ordering each row is judged on comes from its `seq_source`** (HLD-managed-seq §6.1). A row the
application numbered is checked against that number, the one ordering independent of the order rows
were physically inserted. Every other row — one Tandem numbered, one written `unsequenced()`, one whose
provenance this build predates — is checked on its `id`, the only ordering it has. A watermark records
which of the two it holds, and a change resets the entry rather than comparing a `seq` against an `id`,
so the row on which an aggregate switches modes is not judged at all.

**The two reports differ in what they may conclude.** On the `id` key the head-of-chain gate leaves the
commit-order race below as the only way the order can invert, so *"writers are not serialised"* follows
by construction. On the `seq` key the same observation also admits an application numbering its events
inconsistently with its own insert order — a defect, but not a concurrency one — so that message states
the disagreement and stops there. One counter serves both: the metric is the alert, the message is the
diagnosis.

**Why it cannot be found afterwards.** The hazard is a commit-order inversion: `id` is assigned at
INSERT, visibility is decided at COMMIT, so a row inserted first but committed second is invisible to
the claim's snapshot while its successor is published. Once both commit, the table is left in *perfect*
order — `seq` 1 on the lower `id`, `seq` 2 on the higher — so no query over `tandem_outbox` can tell
that anything went wrong. Neither `UNIQUE (aggregate_id, seq)` (two different values) nor the
head-of-chain gate (§3.3, which cannot see an uncommitted row) fires. Only the relay, at publish time,
witnesses the sequence that actually went out. Pinned end to end by `CommitOrderReorderIT`, which also
shows the result is identical at `bucketCount` 1 and 256 — one aggregate always hashes to one bucket, so
serialising the *relay* does not compensate for an unserialised *write side*.

**Where the check runs.** In `RelayWorker.flushDone()`, on the worker's own thread, never in the
dispatch completion handler. That placement is forced rather than chosen: completions must not touch the
database (§3.4), and the disambiguation below issues a query. It pays twice over — the acked queue is
FIFO over completion order, so draining it *is* the publish sequence, and the watermarks are reached
from one thread only and need no synchronization. The check runs strictly **after** `markDoneBatch`, so
a diagnostic can never leave a delivered row `IN_FLIGHT` waiting out a lease.

**The verdict.** Against the last `seq` published for that aggregate: greater (or first seen) advances
the watermark; **equal** is an at-least-once redelivery after a lease reclaim, not an ordering fault;
**lower** is a suspicion, not yet a finding.

**Disambiguating a suspicion.** A replayed row and a reordered one are byte-identical on every field
except `replays` (HLD §8), so a suspicion triggers a single primary-key `OutboxStore.replaysOf(id)`
lookup — `replays > 0` suppresses it, `0` reports it (`ERROR` with the row and aggregate identifiers,
plus `TandemMetrics.incrementOrderViolation()`). Two rules that are easy to get wrong and are pinned by
tests: a suppressed row **never lowers the watermark** (it would mask the next genuine regression), and
an **unknown** count — the port's default, which is what any `OutboxStore` decorator that forgets to
forward the method returns — suppresses too, since a replay cannot be ruled out. The lookup stays off
the hot path by construction: it runs only in the already-rare backwards branch, so `replays` is
deliberately **not** in `claimBatch`'s projection, which is also what lets a relay older than the column
run against a migrated database (HLD §1.4).

**Bounded, and knowingly partial.** `PublishOrderWatermarks` is an LRU capped at **4096 aggregates per worker** —
a fixed constant, not a knob. Unbounded tracking would leak one entry per distinct aggregate for the
life of the process. Eviction degrades detection exactly as a relay restart already does, which the
design accepts: this under-reports and never over-reports. A `LEASE` rebalance moving buckets to
another instance loses the watermarks for their aggregates the same way, and `SINGLE` with several
instances splits one aggregate's history across peers with nothing marking the division — the full list
of when the memory is lost, and when it survives, is in HLD-managed-seq §6. Set
`RelayConfig.orderViolationDetection` to
`false` (Spring: `tandem.relay.order-violation-detection`) where writers are serialised by construction
and the signal is not wanted — nothing is then allocated at all.

---

## 4. Metrics

Emitted through the `TandemMetrics` port (no Micrometer dependency here). Mapping to HLD §7:
`recordLag` / `recordLagAgeSeconds` (both from `OutboxStore.lag()` — a **single** query returning the
count of PENDING rows and the oldest `created_at`, so the two gauges always describe the same instant;
read every `metricsInterval`, default 10 s), `recordFailed` (from `OutboxStore.failedCount()`, the same
cadence — a **live** count of `FAILED` rows, not a tally of failure events: a row can leave `FAILED`
via the admin `DISCARDED` transition, and only a fresh read reflects that; an event-driven counter
would never go back down, permanently misreporting a resolved incident as still open),
`recordBlocked` (from `OutboxStore.blockedCount()`, same cadence — `PENDING` rows sitting behind a
`FAILED` row of their aggregate, which the head-of-chain rule (§3.3) makes permanently unclaimable
until an operator resolves the head. **Not subtracted from `lag()`**: they are undelivered events, and
a backlog gauge that hid them would read healthy while an aggregate is entirely stalled. Reported
separately because without it a single terminal failure makes `lag.age_seconds` climb for ever and
latches any alert built on it — see HLD §7. The query is driven from the `FAILED` rows, grouped by
aggregate, then range-scanned forward on `idx_tandem_outbox_aggregate`, so its cost tracks the number
of blocked rows rather than the size of the outbox; `idx_tandem_outbox_failed` was added for the
`status = 3` step it shares with `failedCount()`, which until then seq-scanned the whole table on every
tick),
`incrementPublished` (on `markDoneBatch`), `recordPublishLatency` (§3.4 — one sample per successfully
published row, computed on `RelayWorker`'s completion handler at the ack instant, never on the
`markDoneBatch` cadence; unlike every gauge above it needs no DB round trip of its own, since both ends
of the measurement — `row.createdAt()` and the ack — are already in hand), `incrementRetry`, `incrementLeaseExpired`
(reclaim count), `recordActiveWorkers` and `recordWorkerCycleAgeSeconds` (both from one `WorkerPool.status()`
call, §3.8 — an in-process, database-free reading, unlike every other metric in this list; the second
is what separates a worker merely alive from one making progress, since `Thread.isAlive()` cannot),
`recordUncoveredBuckets` (from `BucketSource.uncoveredBuckets()`,
same cadence as `lag()`/`failedCount()` — a bucket that is free/expired in `tandem_bucket_lease` **and**
has `PENDING` rows waiting; the `EXISTS` against `tandem_outbox` rides the existing
`idx_tandem_outbox_dispatch` partial index, so the query scans only `tandem_bucket_lease`'s `B` rows, no
new index needed. Empty under `SINGLE` — there is no lease table to stall; `BucketLeaseManager` is the
only implementation).

**No adapter = no cost.** With no `tandem-micrometer` adapter wired, the `TandemMetrics` port is
the no-op default (HLD §7), so each metric's **computation is guarded on `isEnabled()`** — the lag,
failed-count, blocked-count, and uncovered-bucket readings go further and are **never scheduled at
all**, so their queries never run. The `config.invalid` fail-fast metric
(§3.5) is the one exception — it is recorded once at startup regardless, before aborting.

## 5. PostgreSQL vs MySQL

The MySQL port is **not built** (Q28). This section is the specification it must follow. Everything
below was **verified by experiment against MySQL 8.4.11 and `postgres:16-alpine`**, not derived from
documentation — an earlier draft of this section claimed the claim strategy was "already portable",
and §5.2 is the measurement that disproved it.

### 5.1 What actually differs

| Concern | PostgreSQL | MySQL 8 |
|---|---|---|
| Bucket function | computed in Java (`BucketHash`, LLD-core §4) — engine-independent | same Java value (no DB hash function) |
| `SKIP LOCKED` | yes | yes (8.0+), but see §5.2 — the locking clause alone does not carry the semantics over |
| Transaction isolation | `READ COMMITTED` (engine default) | `REPEATABLE READ` (engine default) — **must be overridden**, §5.2 |
| `RETURNING` | yes (single CTE + `RETURNING`) | not supported → two-step claim, §5.3 |
| Array bind (`= ANY(?)`) | yes (`Connection.createArrayOf`) | not supported by Connector/J → generated `IN (?,?,…)` |
| `LIMIT` inside `IN (subquery)` | yes | `ERROR 1235` → wrap in a derived table |
| Subquery over the table being updated | yes | `ERROR 1093` → same derived-table wrapping |
| Locking-clause order | `… FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT n` | **reversed**: `… LIMIT n FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; the PostgreSQL order is a syntax error |
| Unique-violation detection | `SQLSTATE 23505` | `SQLSTATE 23000` + **vendor errno 1062** (23000 alone is any integrity violation) |
| `key` as a column name | legal unquoted | **reserved word** → backticks, or the statement fails to parse |
| Types | `JSONB`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `BIGINT GENERATED … IDENTITY` | `JSON`, `DATETIME(3)`/`TIMESTAMP(3)`, `BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT` |
| Sub-second clock | `now()` | `now()` is **second-precision** — every lease expression needs `now(3)` |
| Partial indexes | yes | not supported → full index with `status` as the leading column |
| JSON round-trip | `jsonb`, keys normalised | `JSON`, keys normalised — payload/headers port unchanged |

### 5.2 The claim: isolation level is load-bearing

**Tandem has always run at `READ COMMITTED`.** It never had to say so, because that is PostgreSQL's
default and the code never sets a level. MySQL defaults to `REPEATABLE READ`, and under that default
the relay **scales negatively**.

The head-of-chain claim (§3.3) makes the optimiser choose **`PRIMARY`** as the access path — not
`idx_tandem_outbox_dispatch` — in order to satisfy `ORDER BY id LIMIT n`. Under `REPEATABLE READ`
every row *examined* takes a next-key lock, whether or not it matches the `WHERE`. Measured with
one worker of four claiming a batch of 10 from buckets `{0,4}`, over 200 000 rows across 400
aggregates and B = 8:

| Isolation | Rows returned | Locks taken | Spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REPEATABLE READ` | 10 | **37** | **all 8 buckets** — 27 of them on rows owned by other workers |
| `READ COMMITTED` | 10 | **10** | buckets 0 and 4 only |

So under the default, bucket granularity — the property the entire worker/instance isolation rests
on — **disappears**. Throughput, same workload, 15 s per run, batch 10:

| Configuration | 1 worker | 4 workers | Scaling | Mean claim latency, 1 → 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MySQL, `REPEATABLE READ` | 345 rows/s | **216 rows/s** | **0.63× — negative** | 25.9 ms → 138.8 ms (peak 1.79 s) |
| MySQL, `READ COMMITTED` | 307 rows/s | **1 073 rows/s** | **3.49×** (87%) | 29.5 ms → 32.8 ms |
| PostgreSQL (the committed CTE claim) | 693 rows/s | **2 467 rows/s** | 3.56× (89%) | 13.8 ms → 15.2 ms |

Four workers under `REPEATABLE READ` are **37% slower than one**. `READ COMMITTED` restores
PostgreSQL-class scaling.

**The failure mode is silent.** No deadlock, no lock-wait timeout, and effectively no empty batches
(12 out of 353 cycles) — the loss is pure lock *waiting*. A functional integration suite passes green
while production throughput collapses, so **the MySQL test matrix must assert concurrent throughput**,
not just correctness; nothing else detects a regression of this shape.

`READ COMMITTED` is also the semantically correct level here, not merely the faster one: the
head-of-chain `NOT EXISTS` must see the latest committed state of the aggregate's chain, not a
transaction-start snapshot. Weakening the level costs nothing Tandem relies on — exclusivity during
publish is carried by `status = IN_FLIGHT` plus the `locked_until` lease, never by an open
transaction (Q9).

**Recommended mechanism (pending decision):** set the level on the relay's own claim transaction in
the adapter — `Connection.setTransactionIsolation(TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED)`, restored in a
`finally`, since the `DataSource` belongs to the application and is normally pooled. Requiring the
operator to configure `transaction_isolation` server-side is the alternative, and is worse: a
deployment that misses it does not fail, it silently loses ~4× throughput (§1.1 — sensible defaults
over configuration). Either way the client write-side is untouched; only relay connections are
affected.

**The disjoint-bucket invariant is now load-bearing and must be stated as such.** Concurrent claims
never overlap: `WorkerPool.sliceFor` shards by `bucket % workerCount == index` within an instance,
and `LEASE` gives each instance exclusive bucket ownership across instances (§3.2). Under
`READ COMMITTED` that is what keeps workers off each other's rows. It was an implicit consequence of
the design before; on MySQL it is a precondition for throughput, and a change to worker sharding
that broke it would degrade silently.

### 5.3 Statement-level rewrites

The claim (§3.3) becomes two statements in **one explicit transaction** — a real change from the
PostgreSQL path, where every operation runs on autocommit (Q9): `SELECT … ORDER BY id LIMIT n FOR
UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, collect the ids, then `UPDATE … WHERE id IN (:selected_ids)`. Do *not* re-`SELECT
… WHERE locked_by=:me AND status=1` instead: it also returns prior-cycle rows still `IN_FLIGHT`,
causing double dispatch. The locking read returns the row data *before* the update, so the adapter
synthesises the post-claim state (`status`, `locked_by`, `locked_until`) onto the returned
`OutboxRecord` rather than reading it back.

`BucketLeaseManager` (§3.2) is the other substantial rewrite: **four** of its statements depend on
`UPDATE … RETURNING bucket` (claim-deficit, release-excess, release-all, member prune), and two also
hit `ERROR 1235`/`ERROR 1093`. Each becomes a locking `SELECT` followed by an `UPDATE`/`DELETE` in the
same transaction.

Ten of the eleven SQL-carrying classes need dialect-specific statements — `JdbcDiscardService` is the
only one already portable. The `tandem_meta` upserts (`JdbcBucketCountStore`, `JdbcRelayControl`,
`JdbcRelayControlSource`) map `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE/DO NOTHING` to
`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` / `INSERT IGNORE`, and every reference to the `key` column needs backticks.

### 5.4 Schema mapping

The MySQL baseline (`schema/mysql/tandem-baseline.sql`, still to be written) keeps the same table and
column names — it is the same long-lived contract, evolving additively (§1.4). The four partial
indexes have no MySQL equivalent and become full indexes with **`status` as the leading column**
(`(status, bucket, id)`, `(aggregate_id, status, id)`, …). A generated-column workaround buys nothing:
MySQL indexes `NULL`s, so the "partial" index would not actually be sparser. The trade-off is real and
should be stated to operators: these indexes cover `DONE` rows too, so they grow with the whole table
between cleanup passes, unlike their PostgreSQL counterparts.

Timestamps need a decision at the schema level: `DATETIME(3)` with the session pinned to UTC, or
`TIMESTAMP(3)` with `connectionTimeZone=UTC`. `rs.getObject(col, OffsetDateTime.class)` behaves
differently across the two, and every lease is compared against the DB clock — this is the easiest
correctness trap in the port to miss.

Bucket seeding replaces `generate_series` with a recursive CTE (verified: seeds B = 256 rows).

### 5.5 Still open (Q28)

- **Adapter structure** — a `SqlDialect` seam inside `tandem-jdbc` with the engine detected from
  `DatabaseMetaData`, versus a separate module. Roughly 2 400 of the module's 3 400 lines
  (`WorkerPool`, `RelayWorker`, `BucketLeaseManager`, backoff, config) are engine-neutral
  orchestration that a second module would duplicate.
- **Test matrix** — which suites run against both engines, and where the concurrent-throughput
  assertion called for in §5.2 lives.
- **Gap locks at scale** — §5.2's measurements are single-node, B = 8, with a stored-procedure
  harness in which *neither* engine pays a JDBC round-trip. The real two-step claim pays one more
  than PostgreSQL's single CTE, so the measured MySQL/PostgreSQL throughput gap is a **lower bound**.
  Behaviour under `LEASE` with several instances is not yet measured.
- `mysql-connector-j` is GPLv2-with-FOSS-exception and must stay **test-only**, never a redistributed
  dependency (THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES stays unchanged).

## 6. Basic-round configuration defaults

The defaults the basic round needs (the full property reference is the `tandem.*` contract in the Spring modules, LLD-spring-config §2):

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bucketCount` (B) | 256 | immutable after first deploy (B5) |
| `coordination` | `SINGLE` | `SINGLE` (one relay instance owns all buckets, no table) or `LEASE` (lease-partitioned, any number of instances); statically declared (§3.2) |
| `instanceId` | derived `host-pid-<rand>` | `LEASE` only: unique lease owner (≤ 64 chars); operator may override for stability across restarts |
| `bucketLease` | 30 s | `LEASE` only: bucket-ownership lease, renewed each `reclaimInterval`; **independent** of `rowLease` (§3.2/§3.5) |
| `workersPerInstance` | `cores × 2` | per-process worker threads |
| `pollInterval` | 100 ms | **idle backoff** when a claim returns empty, ±20% jitter; not a per-batch sleep (§3.1). A cycle that *throws* backs off from here exponentially, capped at `reclaimInterval` |
| `batchSize` | 100 | claim batch = **per-shard in-flight concurrency window** (§3.4) |
| `rowLease` | 60 s | row IN_FLIGHT lease; **hard invariant `rowLease > delivery.timeout.ms`** (default = 2×); relay fail-fasts otherwise (§3.5) |
| backoff | base 1 s, ×2, cap ~5 min, max 10 attempts | full jitter (§3.6) |
| `retention` | 14 days | cleanup of DONE/DISCARDED (§3.7) |
| `metricsInterval` | 10 s | how often the lag gauges are read; the job is **only scheduled when a metrics adapter is wired** (§4) |
| `logEveryRows` | 10,000 | per-worker `INFO` progress log every N dispatch outcomes (ok + ko combined) — a row-count cadence, not a clock one, so an idle relay stays silent; unlike `metricsInterval`, always on, no adapter needed |
| `topicSuffix` | `-topic` | LLD-kafka §5 |
| `defaultContentType` | `application/json` | LLD-kafka §3.2 |

The **baseline DDL** to create is `tandem_outbox` + its indexes (HLD §5.1) plus, for the `LEASE`
coordination mode (§3.2), `tandem_bucket_lease` + `tandem_relay_member` (§1). Optional features add
their tables only when enabled.

**Delivery (decided):** the schema's source of truth is a **Liquibase changelog per DB**, committed at
[`schema/postgres/changelog/`](../schema/postgres/changelog/); **the library does not run migrations
itself** — Tandem ships the changelog, the operator applies it. Liquibase is a build-time tool only
and is **not a dependency of any published module**: it never reaches an adopter's classpath, and the
minimal-client-footprint rule (§1.3) is untouched.

Two ways to consume it, both producing the same schema:

- **Liquibase users** point `liquibase update` (or `spring.liquibase.change-log`) at
  `db.changelog-master.xml` and get change tracking with it. The changelog ships **inside the
  `tandem-jdbc` jar** under `tandem/schema/postgres/changelog/`, so it can be referenced as
  `classpath:` without copying files out of the repository. That resource path is a published
  contract — renaming it breaks every configuration that names it.
- **Everyone else** applies the flat
  [`schema/postgres/tandem-baseline.sql`](../schema/postgres/tandem-baseline.sql) to an empty
  database, exactly as before. That file is **generated** from the changelog
  (`./gradlew generateBaselineSql`) and must never be hand-edited; `check` regenerates and compares
  it, so a changelog change that is not reflected there fails the build rather than drifting in
  silence.

A changeset that has shipped is **immutable** — an operator's `DATABASECHANGELOG` already records its
checksum — so a schema change appends a new `v<n>` file rather than editing an existing one. Only text
*inside* a changeset reaches the generated baseline, which is why the section headings and rationale
live within the changesets they describe. Adopting Liquibase on a database created from an earlier
flat baseline needs one `liquibase changelog-sync` to record the already-applied changesets.

The MySQL changelog (`schema/mysql/…`) is **pending Q28** — the schema mapping it must follow
(status-prefixed indexes, timestamp precision, bucket seeding) is specified in §5.4; the `bucket` is
computed in Java so there is no DB bucket function to port.
The schema must stay **additive** across versions (§1.4).

## 7. Manual wiring without Spring (basic round)

The basic round runs with **no Spring** — assemble the pieces directly:

```java
// write-side (call inside your own @Transactional):
OutboxRepository repo = new JdbcOutboxRepository(dataSource, bucketCount);
repo.insert(OutboxMessage.builder()...payload(bytes).build());   // payload is byte[] (you serialize)

// relay (embedded, or its own process):
OutboxStore       store      = new JdbcOutboxStore(dataSource, bucketCount);
TopicRouter       router     = TopicRouter.kebabWithSuffix("-topic");
OutboxDispatcher  dispatcher = new KafkaRelay(kafkaProps, router);          // tandem-kafka

// SINGLE (default — a single relay instance):
WorkerPool        relay      = new WorkerPool(store, dispatcher, cfg);      // §3.1, owns all buckets

// LEASE (multiple relay instances — embedded-multi-replica or standalone):
//   BucketSource.forCoordination picks embedded(B) for SINGLE, a BucketLeaseManager for LEASE.
BucketSource      buckets    = BucketSource.forCoordination(cfg, dataSource);   // §3.2
WorkerPool        relay      = new WorkerPool(store, dispatcher, cfg,
                                   TandemMetrics.NOOP, Clock.systemUTC(),
                                   BackoffStrategy.fullJitter(), buckets);       // full constructor

// With Admin-API pause/resume support (HLD-admin-api §4.1) — an eighth argument, RelayControlSource,
// publishes this instance's coordination mode to tandem_meta, caches the desired pause state, and
// heartbeats on the same cadence (for RelayStatus.state == DOWN) - reclaimInterval is also the
// heartbeat cadence, published once at startup so the admin can compute a staleness threshold:
RelayControlSource control    = new JdbcRelayControlSource(dataSource, cfg.coordination(), cfg.reclaimInterval());
WorkerPool        relay       = new WorkerPool(store, dispatcher, cfg,
                                   TandemMetrics.NOOP, Clock.systemUTC(),
                                   BackoffStrategy.fullJitter(), buckets, control);

relay.start();
// on shutdown: relay.stop();   // graceful — buckets released (LEASE), in-flight recovered by row lease
```

**Serialization in the basic round.** There is **no default `PayloadSerializer` without Spring** (a
JSON default ships in `tandem-spring-producer`; LLD-core §2.4). So in the basic round the client **serializes
the payload to `byte[]` itself** and passes the bytes (optionally setting `contentType`, persisted to
`headers["content-type"]`, §2). The end-to-end `TandemTestContainer` test does the same — it serializes
a sample payload to bytes and asserts the CloudEvent body on the topic (LLD-test §4).

`tandem-spring-producer` later automates exactly this wiring; nothing here requires it.

## 8. Open items touching this module (post basic round)

- **Q6** — full property reference (the `tandem.*` contract in `tandem-spring-producer` / `tandem-spring-relay`, LLD-spring-config §2); the basic-round defaults are in §6.
- **Q28** — the MySQL port. Specified in §5 (verified by experiment); what remains undecided is
  listed in §5.5. Note §5.2: the claim is **not** portable as-is — `READ COMMITTED` is a requirement,
  not a tuning option.
- ~~The `tandem_bucket_lease` table doubles as / aligns with the relay heartbeat-status the Admin API
  needs~~ — **done**: `JdbcRelayQuery`/`JdbcRelayControl` (`tandem-admin`) read/write the same
  `tandem_bucket_lease`/`tandem_relay_member`/`tandem_meta` tables the relay engine already
  maintains; no separate mechanism (HLD-admin-api §4.1).

*(Q17 — producer retriable/permanent classification — resolved in LLD-kafka §4; the verdict rides in
`OutboxDispatchException.isRetriable()`, LLD-core §3.)*
