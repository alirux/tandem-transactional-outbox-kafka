# Tandem — `tandem-core` LLD

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)  
**Module:** `tandem-core` · package `com.codingful.tandem.core`  
**Depends on:** nothing (**zero external runtime dependencies**, §1.3)  
**Resolves open questions:** Q1 (port signatures), Q2 (model), Q3 (payload), Q4 (metrics port),
Q5 (exceptions), Q24 (DISCARDED). See [open-questions-lld.md](open-questions-lld.md).

`tandem-core` is the functional core (HLD §1.2): it defines the **models**, the **ports**
(interfaces implemented by the adapters), the **exception** hierarchy, and the **pure logic**
(Lamport merge, status codes). It contains no I/O and no third-party dependencies.

---

## 1. Domain model

### 1.1 `AggregateId` (value object)

```java
public record AggregateId(String value) {
    public AggregateId {
        Objects.requireNonNull(value, "aggregateId");
        if (value.isBlank()) throw new IllegalArgumentException("aggregateId must not be blank");
        if (value.length() > 255) throw new IllegalArgumentException("aggregateId exceeds 255 chars");
    }
    public static AggregateId of(String value) { return new AggregateId(value); }
    @Override public String toString() { return value; }
}
```

A typed value object (Q2) — prevents mixing the several string fields (`aggregateId`,
`aggregateType`, `type`). Length bound mirrors `VARCHAR(255)`.

### 1.2 `OutboxStatus` (enum ↔ `SMALLINT`)

```java
public enum OutboxStatus {
    PENDING(0), IN_FLIGHT(1), DONE(2), FAILED(3), DISCARDED(4);   // Q24
    private final int code;
    OutboxStatus(int code) { this.code = code; }
    public int code() { return code; }
    public static OutboxStatus fromCode(int code) { /* switch; throws on unknown */ }
}
```

`DISCARDED` (4) is reachable only via the Admin API on a `FAILED` row; it is never polled and
does not block the aggregate (HLD §5.3).

### 1.3 `OutboxMessage` (write-side value)

What the client builds and inserts — immutable, with a builder.

```java
public final class OutboxMessage {
    private final AggregateId aggregateId;
    private final String aggregateType;
    private final String type;            // CloudEvents `type` (nullable; see Q20)
    private final long   seq;             // meaningful only when seqSource == APPLICATION (HLD §4.2)
    private final SeqSource seqSource;    // APPLICATION | MANAGED | NONE — which of the three modes the caller stated
    private final boolean lockedWrite;    // opted in via lockedWrite(): an advisory lock serialises writers (HLD-managed-seq §4.2)
    private final byte[] payload;         // already serialized (Q3)
    private final String contentType;     // e.g. "application/json"; persisted into headers["content-type"] (LLD-jdbc §2)
    private final Map<String,String> headers;     // immutable copy; may be empty

    // builder(); accessors; equals/hashCode use Arrays.equals on payload
    public static Builder builder() { ... }
}
```

- **Payload is `byte[]`** (Q3): the core never serializes, so it forces no JSON library on the
  client (§1.3). Higher tiers may offer an `Object`-accepting overload backed by a
  `PayloadSerializer` (below); the plain tier passes bytes/`String`.
- **`seq` has three modes and no default** ([HLD-managed-seq](HLD-managed-seq.md) §4.5, §4.6): the
  core never generates a number. `seq(long)` supplies the aggregate's own, `managedSeq()` leaves it to
  the `tandem_seq` column default (the write-side adapter omits the column), and `unsequenced()` gives
  the row none at all. They are mutually exclusive and `build()` rejects a message stating more than
  one — structurally, not by convention, so a malformed `entity.getVersion()` can never opt an
  aggregate in silently. It also rejects a message stating **none**, and that failure names all three
  and what each is for: the choice fixes the row's wire contract and how strongly its published order
  can be checked, so it is made deliberately rather than inherited.
  `seq()` **throws** `IllegalStateException` rather than returning `0` on any message that carries no
  number of its own — a plausible-looking zero would reach `ce_seq` and the logs as if it were real.
  Guard with **`hasSeq()`**; branch on **`seqSource()`** where the mode itself matters. `OutboxRecord`
  refuses a message still awaiting a managed number, since it describes a *persisted* row, and carries
  its own `seqSource` read from the column — a resolved managed number is indistinguishable from an
  application-assigned one once stored, so for a persisted row the record's accessor is the authority,
  not the wrapped message's.
- **`lockedWrite`** asks the write-side adapter to serialise concurrent writers to the aggregate with
  a transaction-scoped advisory lock ([HLD-managed-seq](HLD-managed-seq.md) §4.2) — independent of
  `seqSource()`, combines with any of the three modes. Unlike them it changes no readable value on
  the message; it is consumed only by the adapter at insert.
- **`contentType`** is the only typed convenience field that maps onto a header: the write-side
  serializes it into `headers["content-type"]` at insert (LLD-jdbc §2), the key the relay reads for
  the CloudEvents `datacontenttype` (LLD-kafka §3.2). No dedicated column — reuse `headers` (Pareto).
- **No `causationId` here.** Causation belongs to the **causal-ordering** feature (the peer of
  `lamport`; HLD §9), which is designed but **not built** — `TandemHeaders.CAUSATION_ID` declares the
  header name and nothing writes it ([HLD-causal-ordering.md](HLD-causal-ordering.md) §0). If the feature is
  ever built, causation propagates as a header/extension exactly like `lamport`, never as a field on
  this write value — keeping the common path free of plumbing for a capability it does not use.

### 1.4 `OutboxRecord` (stored row)

The persisted row with delivery state, returned by the relay-side store and the Admin API.

```java
public final class OutboxRecord {
    private final long id;
    private final OutboxMessage message;
    private final OutboxStatus status;
    private final int    attempts;
    private final String lockedBy;        // nullable
    private final Instant lockedUntil;    // nullable
    private final String lastError;       // nullable
    private final Instant nextAttemptAt;  // nullable
    private final Instant createdAt;
    private final Long   lamport;         // nullable; reserved, always null today (§9)
    // accessors
}
```

### 1.5 `EncodedMessage` (wire-ready message)

What a `MessageEncoder` (§2.4) produces: the shape every broker Tandem publishes to has in common.

```java
public final class EncodedMessage {
    private final String destination;        // Kafka topic, AMQP exchange, …
    private final String key;                // ordering key = aggregate_id; null only where the transport has none
    private final byte[] body;
    private final Map<String, byte[]> headers;
    // accessors
}
```

**Headers are `byte[]`**, the one representation no broker loses. Kafka headers are bytes already,
and a typed property model (AMQP) can narrow bytes to its own types, while the reverse would force
this value to pick a type system and every other transport to undo it.

**It hands over ownership and copies nothing**, unlike `OutboxMessage` (§1.3). It lives for exactly
one dispatch on the relay's hot path, between the encoder that built it and the transport adapter
that writes it, so cloning the body and every header value per message would be pure allocation; an
encoder must not retain or mutate what it passes. Its `toString` prints `bodyBytes`/`headerNames`
only, never a value (AGENTS.md logging §5).

## 2. Ports

Ports are interfaces **defined by the core** and implemented by adapters (HLD §1.2). The
"implemented in" column is informative — the signatures live here.

| Port | Implemented in | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OutboxRepository` | `tandem-jdbc` (+ `InMemoryOutbox`) | Write-side insert |
| `OutboxStore` | `tandem-jdbc` | Relay-side persistence (poll/claim/update/cleanup) |
| `OutboxDispatcher` | `tandem-kafka` | Publish one record to Kafka |
| `PayloadSerializer` | client / `tandem-spring-producer` (JSON) | Object → bytes |
| `MessageEncoder` | `tandem-kafka` (`KafkaMessageEncoder`, CloudEvents default) | Record → wire message |
| `TopicRouter` | `tandem-kafka` (default) | `aggregateType` → topic |
| `CausalContext` | *(nobody — reserved, see HLD-causal-ordering.md §0)* | Inbound Lamport timestamp |
| `TracePropagator` | core (no-op) / `tandem-spring-producer`, `tandem-tracing-otel` | Trace capture (§7.1) |
| `TandemMetrics` | core (no-op) / `tandem-micrometer` | Metrics (§7) |
| `ReplayService` | `tandem-jdbc` | Replay (§8) |
| `TandemAggregate` | client's aggregate | Expose pending messages (annotation tier) |

### 2.1 Write-side

```java
public interface OutboxRepository {
    void insert(OutboxMessage message);                 // within the caller's transaction
    void insertAll(Collection<OutboxMessage> messages); // same transaction
}
```

### 2.2 Relay-side persistence

```java
public interface OutboxStore {
    /** Poll the worker's owned virtual buckets for the **head of each aggregate's pending
        chain** (the earliest not-yet-DONE row, E2 — which also subsumes the poison gate) and
        mark the batch IN_FLIGHT for this worker (Q8: virtual-bucket sharding, §4.3/§6).
        Transaction boundaries: Q9 (LLD-jdbc). */
    List<OutboxRecord> claimBatch(Set<Integer> buckets, String workerId,
                                  Duration lease, int batchSize);
    void markDone(long id);
    void markForRetry(long id, String error, Duration retryDelay);    // → PENDING; delay is
                                                                      // relative — the adapter
                                                                      // anchors it on the DB clock
    void markFailed(long id, String error);                           // → FAILED
    int  reclaimExpiredLeases();                                       // → PENDING; returns count
    int  cleanup(Instant doneBefore, int batchSize);                  // housekeeping (Q12)
    default Optional<LagSnapshot> lag() { return Optional.empty(); }   // backlog reading for the
                                                                      // lag gauges; read only while
                                                                      // metrics are on (LLD-jdbc §4)
    default OptionalLong failedCount() { return OptionalLong.empty(); }  // live count of FAILED rows
                                                                      // for failed.count; same
                                                                      // read-only-while-on rule
    default OptionalLong blockedCount() { return OptionalLong.empty(); } // PENDING rows behind a FAILED
                                                                      // head — counted by lag() too,
                                                                      // never subtracted from it
}
```

### 2.3 Publish

```java
public interface OutboxDispatcher {
    /** Publish the record **asynchronously**. The returned future completes when the broker
        acks (acks=all), or completes **exceptionally** with an {@link OutboxDispatchException}
        carrying the retriable/permanent verdict (Q17). The dispatcher never blocks on the ack,
        so the relay can keep many records of **distinct aggregates** in flight on a single
        producer — the per-shard concurrency window (LLD-jdbc §3.4). */
    CompletableFuture<Void> dispatch(OutboxRecord record);
}
```

`dispatch` is non-blocking by contract: per-aggregate ordering is enforced *upstream* (the relay
ever has only one row per aggregate — its head — in flight; LLD-jdbc §3.3/§3.4), not by blocking
here. `CompletableFuture` is `java.util.concurrent` (JDK), so the zero-dependency rule holds.

### 2.4 Serialization, routing & message format

```java
public interface PayloadSerializer {
    byte[] serialize(Object payload);   // throws PayloadSerializationException
    String contentType();               // e.g. "application/json"
}

public interface TopicRouter {
    String topicFor(OutboxRecord record);   // the single routing method; default rule = Q18

    /** Default router: kebab-case(aggregateType) + suffix (LLD-kafka §5). */
    static TopicRouter kebabWithSuffix(String suffix) { /* … */ }
}

public interface MessageEncoder {
    EncodedMessage encode(OutboxRecord record);   // §1.5; throws ⇒ permanent (LLD-kafka §4)
}
```

There is **no default `PayloadSerializer` in core** (a JSON one needs a JSON library — §1.3).
A Jackson-based default ships in `tandem-spring-producer`; non-Spring users supply one or pass bytes.

**Format and transport are separate ports.** `MessageEncoder` decides *what* goes on the wire,
`OutboxDispatcher` *where*, so a new format costs an encoder rather than a transport adapter, and a
new transport inherits the formats already written. CloudEvents is Tandem's default, not its premise
(HLD-cloudevents §8), and the payload encoding is orthogonal again: it rides in `datacontenttype`.

A format whose binding differs per transport is the reason the port does not stand alone. CloudEvents
names its attributes `ce_*` over Kafka and `cloudEvents_*` over AMQP, so its encoder is built against
the transport's own binding library in that transport's adapter: `KafkaMessageEncoder` in
`tandem-kafka`, which writes a `ProducerRecord` directly and which `KafkaMessageEncoder.from` also
lifts a neutral encoder into (LLD-kafka §3). `MessageEncoder` describes the neutral case honestly
rather than claiming every format has one shape.

What stays shared in that arrangement is the part a consumer actually observes. The CloudEvents
*envelope* is built once in `tandem-cloudevents`, which knows no broker; only the mapping of its
attributes onto a given wire lives in the adapter (HLD-cloudevents §5). A second transport adapter
therefore restates a binding, never the attribute sources, the `type` fallback or the `seq` rule.

### 2.5 Optional capability ports (no-op defaults in core)

```java
public interface TandemMetrics {                       // §7
    default boolean isEnabled() { return false; }
    void recordLag(long pending);
    void recordLagAgeSeconds(double age);
    void incrementPublished(long n);
    void recordFailed(long count);
    void incrementRetry();
    void incrementLeaseExpired(long n);
    void recordActiveWorkers(int n);
    void recordUncoveredBuckets(int n);   // buckets with PENDING rows but no live owner (§7)
    void recordConfigInvalid(String check); // startup config invariant violated (e.g. rowLease ≤ delivery.timeout.ms); LLD-jdbc §3.5
}

public interface TracePropagator {                     // §7.1, HLD-tracing.md §5
    default boolean isEnabled() { return false; }
    Map<String,String> capture();   // {} when disabled
    static TracePropagator composite(TracePropagator... delegates);  // merge; earlier wins on collision
    static TracePropagator fromTandemContext();  // correlation id only, reads TandemContext, no library needed
}

public interface TandemSpanRecorder {                   // §7.1, HLD-tracing.md §5–§6 (relay-side, instrumented mode)
    String PUBLISH_SPAN_NAME = "tandem.relay.publish";
    default boolean isEnabled() { return false; }
    Span startPublishSpan(long rowId, String aggregateType, String aggregateId, int attempts,
            String topic, String traceparent, String tracestate, String correlationId);  // Span.NOOP when disabled

    interface Span {
        void end();
        void end(Throwable failure);
    }
}

public interface CausalContext {                       // §9 — RESERVED, nothing wires it
    OptionalLong inboundTimestamp();   // empty → mutation is a causal root
}
```

`CausalContext` is listed here for completeness but is **not** an optional capability port in the
sense of the two above: it has no `isEnabled()` (an empty `OptionalLong` is the guard) and no
adapter, no caller and no enablement switch exist. It is reserved API for the unbuilt
cross-aggregate causal-ordering feature — inventory and status in
[HLD-causal-ordering.md](HLD-causal-ordering.md) §0.

`TandemSpanAttributes` (also `tandem-core`) declares the `tandem.*` attribute names every
`TandemSpanRecorder` adapter tags a span with — one declaration shared by the Micrometer
(`tandem-spring-relay`) and OpenTelemetry (`tandem-tracing-otel`) adapters, so the two never drift
apart on what an operator's saved dashboard query is written against.

The **no-op defaults** make every capability zero-cost when off; callers also guard on
`isEnabled()` before building any payload (HLD §7.1).

### 2.6 Replay & aggregate hook

```java
public interface ReplayService {                       // §8
    ReplayResult replay(ReplayCriteria criteria);      // honours dryRun
}
public record ReplayCriteria(AggregateId aggregateId, String aggregateType,
                             Long fromId, Long toId,
                             Set<OutboxStatus> statuses, boolean dryRun) { /* ≥1 selector required */ }
public record ReplayResult(long matched, long replayed, boolean dryRun) {}

public interface TandemAggregate {                     // annotation tier (HLD §3.1)
    Collection<OutboxMessage> pendingOutboxMessages();
}
```

---

## 3. Exception hierarchy (Q5)

All **unchecked** (`RuntimeException`) to keep the API clean — the insert already runs inside the
caller's `@Transactional`.

```java
public class TandemException extends RuntimeException { ... }          // base

public class OutboxInsertException     extends TandemException { ... }  // write-side INSERT failed
public class DuplicateSeqException     extends OutboxInsertException {} // UNIQUE(aggregate_id, seq)
public class PayloadSerializationException extends TandemException { ... }
public class OutboxDispatchException   extends TandemException {         // publish failed (Q17)
    private final boolean retriable;      // the dispatcher's verdict
    public boolean isRetriable() { return retriable; }
}
public class TandemConfigurationException  extends TandemException { ... }
```

`DuplicateSeqException` is the notable one: callers using optimistic locking catch it to detect a
`seq` conflict and retry, without parsing SQL state.

`OutboxDispatchException` **carries the retriable-vs-permanent verdict** (`isRetriable()`): the
`tandem-kafka` dispatcher classifies the Kafka error (LLD-kafka §4) and sets it, so the `tandem-jdbc`
relay routes the failure to `markForRetry` (retriable) or `markFailed` (permanent) without knowing
Kafka exception types — the seam that connects Q17 to Q9/Q10.

---

## 4. Pure logic (in core)

```java
public final class LamportClock {                      // HLD-causal-ordering §3
    /** new = max(local, inbound) + 1 */
    public static long merge(long local, long inbound) { return Math.max(local, inbound) + 1; }
}
```

```java
public final class BucketHash {                       // §4.3 HLD
    /** Virtual bucket for an aggregate id: a 64-bit FNV-1a hash over the UTF-8 bytes of
        {@code aggregateId}, reduced with {@code Math.floorMod} into {@code [0, bucketCount)}.
        Pure, dependency-free, and deterministic across DB engines and versions — so the
        stored bucket is stable for the life of the data (HLD §4.3). */
    public static int bucketFor(String aggregateId, int bucketCount) {
        long h = 0xcbf29ce484222325L;                 // FNV-1a 64-bit offset basis
        for (byte b : aggregateId.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
            h ^= (b & 0xff);
            h *= 0x100000001b3L;                       // FNV-1a 64-bit prime
        }
        return Math.floorMod(h, bucketCount);          // non-negative, overflow-free, any bucketCount
    }
}
```

`Math.floorMod` is used deliberately: it is always non-negative and **overflow-free even for
`Long.MIN_VALUE`** (unlike `abs(...) % n`, which overflows on the minimum value), and it works
for any `bucketCount`, not only powers of two.

Other pure helpers: `OutboxStatus.fromCode`, header-name constants (`ce_logicalclock`,
`traceparent`, `correlation-id`, `causation_id`), and the CloudEvents header keys. The
**bucket hash is computed in Java by the core** (above): `tandem-jdbc` calls it at insert and
`InMemoryOutbox` calls the *same* function, so in-memory tests and the real database agree on
the bucket. The core defines both the `(bucket, bucketCount)` contract **and** the hash itself —
nothing DB-side.

## 5. Still-open items touching this module

These are referenced by the signatures above but resolved in other LLDs:

- **Q18** — exact default `TopicRouter` rule (`tandem-kafka`).
- **Q9** — transaction boundaries of the poll→publish→DONE cycle (`tandem-jdbc`). *(Q8 resolved:
  **virtual-bucket sharding** — fixed `B`, workers own bucket subsets; `SINGLE` (in-process, all
  buckets) or `LEASE` (`tandem_bucket_lease`-table) coordination; structural exclusivity, §4.3.)*
- **Q20** — behaviour when `type` is null (`tandem-kafka`).
- **Q6** — consolidated property reference (`tandem-spring-producer` / `tandem-spring-relay`; the `tandem.*` contract is specified in LLD-spring-config §2).
