# AGENTS.md

Conventions for anyone (human or AI agent) working in this repository. These are
project-wide and committed on purpose — follow them for every change.

Tandem is a Java library implementing the Transactional Outbox Pattern: reliable,
causally-ordered event delivery from PostgreSQL/MySQL to Apache Kafka without CDC
infrastructure. See [docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) for the architecture and design
decisions.

## Design philosophy — Pareto's Law

Tandem must be **useful and simple for at least 80% of use cases** — a service on
PostgreSQL/MySQL + Kafka needing reliable, ordered event delivery. Apply this decision
rule to every change: **if a feature makes the common case harder, slower, or more
confusing in order to serve a minority case, it does not belong in the core path** — make
it opt-in, a separate adapter/optional module, or out of scope. Prefer sensible defaults
over configuration, keep `tandem-core` dependency-free and the common API minimal, and
integrate with specialised tools (Flink, Kafka Streams) for the hard 20% rather than
reinventing them. See [docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) §1.1.

## Architecture — Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

When a component has a clear functional core with at least one port and one adapter,
structure it as **Ports & Adapters**: the core holds pure logic and *defines* the ports
(interfaces); technology-specific code is an *adapter* implementing a port. Invariant:
**adapters depend on the core; the core never depends on an adapter** — `tandem-core`
stays dependency-free. The in-memory adapter (`InMemoryOutbox`) is what lets the core be
tested without a database. Do not impose this ceremony where there is no swappable
boundary (Pareto, §1.1). See [docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) §1.2.

## API-first

Any external API Tandem exposes (starting with the Admin API) is built **contract-first**:
the OpenAPI document is the source of truth, authored and reviewed **before** the
implementation. The implementation must conform to the committed contract — generate stubs
from it or validate against it in CI; never back-derive the spec from the code. **Every API
change starts in the spec**: edit and review the OpenAPI, then implement; a breaking
contract change is a breaking library change (semver). The Admin API contract lives at
[docs/admin-api.openapi.yaml](docs/admin-api.openapi.yaml). See [docs/HLD-admin-api.md](docs/HLD-admin-api.md).

**Validate every API contract in CI** so spec problems are caught at build time,
independent of any editor. Specmatic (below) consolidates this — it fails on a malformed
contract as part of its conformance/backward-compat checks, so a standalone validate step is
largely redundant; `redocly lint` stays optional for style/governance rules only.

**Design for backward *and* forward compatibility — for *every* contract, not just the REST
API.** This covers the **DB schema** (`tandem_*` tables) and the **published Kafka messages**
(CloudEvents envelope + headers) as much as the API, because the split topology runs
client/relay/admin at possibly-different versions on the same DB and event stream (HLD §1.4).
Evolve **additively only** (new optional columns/fields/endpoints/extensions; never remove,
rename, retype, make-required, narrow ranges, or change an identifier like an error `type`
slug or an event `type`); breaking changes go to a new major version (`/v2`; DB: versioned
migration). And keep readers **forward-compatible / tolerant**: in SQL select **named columns,
never `SELECT *`** and tolerate extra columns; for Kafka ignore unknown headers/extension
attributes; for REST ignore unknown fields and enum values and keep schemas **open** (no
`additionalProperties: false`). **Over-strict validation breaks readers the moment the
contract grows.**

**Error responses follow RFC 9457** (Problem Details, `application/problem+json`) for any
external API Tandem exposes — `type` / `title` / `status` / `detail` / `instance`, extensions
allowed. Not a bespoke error shape. The `type` is always a canonical
`https://tandem.codingful.com/problems/{slug}` URL (never `about:blank`); the kebab-case
`{slug}` is the stable identifier and must never change once published. **Those URLs are
dereferenceable and must stay that way**: each one resolves to a page under [`site/problems/`](site/),
published to `tandem.codingful.com`. Adding a problem type to the contract therefore means adding
its page in the same change — a `type` URL that 404s is a broken contract, not a missing nicety.

**Contract testing is provider-side spec conformance, never consumer-driven.** Tandem
publishes its API contract (OpenAPI) to unknown/external consumers, so the provider stays
authoritative — verify the implementation against the spec (swagger-request-validator in the
integration tests; Specmatic for generative conformance + spec backward-compatibility
checks). Do **not** introduce Pact / Spring Cloud Contract or any consumer-driven contract
tooling. See [docs/HLD-admin-api.md](docs/HLD-admin-api.md) §5.

## Minimal client footprint

The part of Tandem the **client app imports** — the write-side (the outbox INSERT) — must
carry the **minimum external dependencies, ideally none**. `tandem-core` stays
zero-dependency; the write-side must not pull in the Kafka client, the CloudEvents SDK,
tracing libraries, a mandatory JSON binding, or Spring (unless the user opts into a Spring
tier). Anything needing an external dependency belongs on the relay/optional side, never on
the client path. Where the write-side needs a library, prefer the client's existing one
(`provided`/optional) or a pluggable SPI with no forced default. See [docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) §1.3.

When you change a **redistributed compile/runtime dependency** — add or remove an `api`/
`implementation` dependency, or bump the version of one, in any published module (`tandem-core`,
`tandem-jdbc`, `tandem-kafka`) — update [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) in the same
change: keep its per-module table, dependency list (name, version, license), and license-text
sections in sync. Test-only and benchmark-only dependencies are excluded and need no update.

## Logging

**Logging API is per-module, tied to the minimal-client-footprint boundary (§1.3), not a
blanket "use SLF4J" rule.** `tandem-core` and `tandem-jdbc` carry the client write-side in the
same jar as the relay engine, so both must log via the JDK's dependency-free
**`java.lang.System.Logger`** — never add SLF4J/Log4j2 there, it would land on the client's
classpath. `tandem-kafka` is relay-only and already pulls `slf4j-api` transitively via
`kafka-clients`, so it logs via **SLF4J** at no extra footprint cost. `tandem-sample` and
`tandem-benchmark` are leaf apps, not libraries — they may take a concrete logging backend, and
both use `slf4j-simple` (zero-config; their real output is `System.out` report text, so a
configurable backend would be weight for nothing). The library **ships no logging configuration** (no `logback.xml`/`log4j2.xml`) —
routing logs is the consuming application's job, same reasoning as every other unopinionated
default (§1.1). See [docs/HLD-logging.md](docs/HLD-logging.md).

1. **Always pass the `Throwable` to the logger**, never just `exception.getMessage()`
   concatenated into the string — that silently discards the stack trace and is the single
   most common way to make an `ERROR` log undebuggable.
2. **Every `ERROR`/`WARN` includes the identifiers needed to find the affected record**
   without re-running the failing operation: bucket id, worker index, aggregate id, Kafka
   topic/partition, outbox row id. A bare message with no id is close to useless once more
   than one relay instance or worker is running.
3. **Fixed message text, then a flat `name:value` tail — never interleave data mid-sentence.**
   `"Relay worker died; restarting workerIndex:3"`, not `"Relay worker 3 died; restarting"`.
   The message stays a constant string (greppable, aggregatable across occurrences); every
   variable goes after it as `name:value` pairs separated by `, `, always in the same order.
   Applies equally to SLF4J `{}` placeholders and `System.Logger` string concatenation — only
   *how* the value is inserted differs, never *where*. No brackets, no `=`, just `name:value`.
4. **Level by frequency, not by importance**: once per relay lifecycle or coordination event →
   `INFO`; once per poll/claim/dispatch cycle → `DEBUG`; once per row → `TRACE` (never `DEBUG`
   — a busy outbox would flood it). `FATAL` is not used — an unrecoverable failure is an
   `ERROR` plus the exception that stops the process.
5. **Never log payload/event bodies, credentials, tokens, JDBC URLs with embedded passwords,
   or bound SQL parameter values.** Structural identifiers, counts, timings, and the opaque
   `correlation-id`/`trace_id` values are safe to log; the business data they point to is not.
   **This applies to `toString()` too** — every `tandem-core` type reachable from a log
   statement (`OutboxRecord`, `OutboxMessage`, …) must keep the same rule: never print
   `payload`/`headers` values (print `payloadBytes=<length>`/`headerNames=<keySet()>` instead),
   only the structural identifiers. **Every such `toString()` gets a unit test** that builds
   the type with a fake-sensitive payload/header/error value and asserts the rendered string
   `doesNotContain(...)` it — a plain "does it compile" check is not enough, the whole point is
   to catch a future field addition that accidentally starts printing something it shouldn't
   (see `OutboxMessageTest`/`OutboxRecordTest` for the pattern).
6. **CLI/report output is not logging.** `tandem-benchmark`'s scenario results and
   `tandem-sample`'s walkthrough narration are the tool's product, meant to be read or piped —
   keep them as `System.out`. Reserve the logger for genuine diagnostics an operator would
   filter by level.
7. **Every log message starts with a capital letter** — a style rule, applied regardless of
   level or logging API (`System.Logger` or SLF4J).

## Javadoc

Applies to every published module (`tandem-core`, `tandem-jdbc`, `tandem-kafka`,
`tandem-test`, `tandem-spring-producer`, `tandem-spring-relay`, `tandem-micrometer`,
`tandem-admin`, …) — their javadoc jar is generated automatically by the
`com.vanniktech.maven.publish` plugin and is the first thing an external consumer sees
in their IDE. Package-private/internal classes (e.g. `RelayWorker`, `MiniJson`,
`OutboxRowMapper`, `CloudEventEncoder`) are out of scope — they never reach the
published jar.

1. **Every public class/interface gets a javadoc comment** — what it is and, where
   relevant, a pointer to the HLD/LLD section it implements (e.g.
   `(LLD-jdbc §3.3–§3.7)`).
2. **No javadoc on self-explanatory members.** Skip getters/setters/`toString`/
   `equals`/`hashCode` whose name already says everything, and any default-interface
   method whose behaviour is obvious from its name. Same rule as inline code comments:
   document the *why*, not the *what* — never restate the method name in prose.
3. **Public constructors are always documented**: what each parameter represents, and
   `@throws IllegalArgumentException`/`@throws NullPointerException` for any validated
   constraint (e.g. `bucketCount` must be positive). A constructor is the contract a
   consumer hits first — it never gets a free pass.
4. **Builder/fluent setters get one line only when the default or a constraint isn't
   obvious from the name** (e.g. `RelayConfig.Builder.rowLease` must be `>
   deliveryTimeoutMs`, with the default value stated). A setter whose name is fully
   self-describing (`aggregateType(String)`) stays undocumented — ten near-identical
   one-liners are noise, not signal.
5. **Public interface (port) methods always get `@param`/`@return`/`@throws`** —
   ports are the hexagonal architecture's contract surface, so their methods must be
   fully specified even when the interface-level javadoc already explains the port's
   purpose.
6. **Don't chase doclint to zero.** The Java 17 javadoc linter flags any method with a
   partial doc comment (missing `@return` on a fluent setter, for instance) as a
   warning. That's expected here — rules 2 and 4 deliberately favor terse, accurate
   javadoc over exhaustively tagged boilerplate. Do not add `@return this` or similar
   filler just to silence the linter.

## Testing

**Framework:** JUnit 6 + AssertJ. Run with `./gradlew test` (coverage report at
`build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml`).

1. **BDD method names**, literal form `GIVEN_..._WHEN_..._THEN_...` — the markers
   `GIVEN`/`WHEN`/`THEN` in uppercase, the descriptive parts in snake_case, e.g.
   `GIVEN_a_pending_message_WHEN_relay_publishes_THEN_status_is_done`.
   Long, non-idiomatic-for-Java names are fine; readability of the scenario wins.
   **Describe the scenario in the use case's business terms, never with Java method
   or class names.** A test name states the *behaviour* (`WHEN_the_relay_claims_work`,
   `WHEN_a_lease_expires`), not the API call that happens to implement it today
   (`WHEN_claimBatch_called`, `WHEN_reclaimExpiredLeases_called`). Names that embed a
   method or type are fragile: renaming the method or refactoring the seam forces a
   rename of every test that still passes, and the name no longer tells the reader
   *why* the behaviour matters. If you cannot phrase the scenario without naming a Java
   symbol, the test is probably pinned to the implementation rather than the behaviour.

2. **Classical / Detroit school — no mocks of any kind.** Use real domain objects
   and real collaborators:
   - **Unit tests:** use `InMemoryOutbox` from `tandem-test` as the real outbox
     collaborator — no database required.
   - **Integration tests:** use `TandemTestContainer` from `tandem-test`, which
     wires up a real PostgreSQL and a real Kafka broker via Testcontainers.
   Refactoring the production code under test to make it testable without mocks is
   explicitly allowed — extract a pure function, change visibility, split a class,
   introduce a seam. Prefer a behaviour-preserving refactor over reaching for a mock.

3. **Test behaviours, not coverage.** Aim for assertions that would fail under
   mutation: cover empty *and* populated inputs, single *and* multiple items,
   ordering, per-aggregate isolation, and failure/retry paths. 100% line coverage
   is not the goal — pinned behaviour is. If a surviving mutant has no possible
   killing input, that signals redundant/dead code to remove, not a test to add.
   **A useless test is a wrong test — don't write it, and delete it if it exists.**
   Useless means it tests the obvious, merely restates the implementation
   (tautology), or exists only to push the coverage number up.

4. **Avoid fragile hardcoded strings**, in three tiers:
   - **Format field names** (JSON/Kafka header names) → use typed constants or
     deserialize into typed records so each name is declared once.
   - **Pass-through values** where the output must equal an input → assert against
     the input object, never repeat the literal.
   - **Test-data strings reused as both input and lookup key** → extract a named
     constant so input and assertion cannot drift.
   Keep a literal only for a genuine *transform output* (e.g. topic routing:
   `router.topicFor(record(aggregateType="OrderLine")) == "order-line-topic"`) —
   deriving it via production code would be tautological.

### Integration tests and Docker

Integration tests in `tandem-test` require Docker (Testcontainers). They run
automatically in CI (GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest has Docker available). Locally,
Docker Desktop or Colima must be running. Integration tests are tagged
`@Tag("integration")` and run as part of `./gradlew check`; skip them with
`./gradlew test -x integrationTest` if Docker is unavailable.

### Spring modules — the dual-generation gate

`tandem-spring-producer` and `tandem-spring-relay` ship **one artifact serving both Spring Boot 3.x and
4.x**, compiled against the 3.x baseline with Spring `compileOnly`. Each therefore has a **`bootFourTest`**
task that re-runs its unit tests with Spring swapped to the latest 4.x on the runtime classpath
(LLD-spring-config §1.2). It is wired into `check`, so CI covers it — but **`./gradlew test` does not run
it**. When you touch a Spring module, the pre-commit gate is **`./gradlew check`** (or at minimum
`./gradlew :<module>:bootFourTest` alongside `test`); a green `test` alone can hide a 4.x regression until
CI. Two rules keep one jar valid on both lines, and neither fails loudly if broken — see LLD-spring-config
§1.1: order autoconfigurations by **name** (`afterName`), never by class literal, and put class conditions
on **`@Bean` methods**, never on a nested `@Configuration`.

**A module that renders JSON has a second axis, and it is not the Boot line.** Since Boot **4.0.0** a
stock `spring-boot-starter-web` brings **Jackson 3** (`tools.jackson`) and no Jackson 2 databind; a Boot 4
application may also opt back into Jackson 2 (`spring-boot-jackson2`), so which binding is present is a
property of the host's classpath, not of its Boot version. The rule: such a module may name Jackson's
**annotations** (`com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*`, shared by both generations) and **neither
generation's databind** — render raw JSON text through `@JsonRawValue` rather than a parsed tree, and pin
timestamps with `@JsonFormat` rather than a mapper you configure. `tandem-admin` enforces this with two
gates you must keep passing: `JacksonFootprintTest` (reads the compiled classes, fails on any databind
reference — the original defect lived in a `@Bean` *signature*, where a source read does not see it) and
the **`jacksonThreeTest` source set**, run on both 4.x lines with Jackson 2 excluded. Note that
`bootFourTest` deliberately keeps Jackson 2 on its classpath — it covers the opt-in cell, not a stock Boot
4 application. Full detail and the measurements: LLD-spring-config §1.3.

## Adding a module — the registration checklist

A module is not wired in by existing there: several **explicit lists** must name it, and each omission
fails *silently* (nothing breaks the build; the module is simply absent from a report, a BOM, or a
release). When you add a module, walk the whole list in the same change:

| Register it in | Why, and what breaks if you forget |
|---|---|
| `settings.gradle.kts` | Gradle ignores the directory entirely otherwise. |
| `tandem-bom/build.gradle.kts` | **Published modules on the library's own version only.** The BOM's job is to let a consumer declare any Tandem module without a version; a module missing there cannot be used that way. An **independently versioned** module (see below) is deliberately excluded, and the omission is recorded as a comment there so nobody "fixes" it. |
| `tandem-coverage`'s `coveredProjects` | **Published, tested modules only.** Only the aggregated report attributes cross-module hits to the owning class, and it is the single report CI uploads to Codecov — a module missing there never reaches Codecov at all. |
| `unpublishedModules` in the root `build.gradle.kts` | **Only for modules that must NOT be published** (sample/benchmark/coverage). It also opts them out of the shared java-library/publishing convention, so they configure their own toolchain and tasks. |
| `dependency-graph-exclude-projects` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | **Only for modules that must NOT be published.** The dependency graph CI submits is scoped to the published runtime footprint (LLD-base §1); an unpublished module missing from that regex puts its demo/benchmark dependencies back into the repository's Dependabot alerts. |
| `README.md` API reference table (**published modules only** — each row links that module's javadoc on javadoc.io, which exists only for a published artifact) · `CONTRIBUTING.md` project layout · `docs/LLD-base.md` (artifactId + package) | Three separate documented module lists — all three go stale independently, and a contributor reading one will not know the module exists. |
| `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` per-module table | **Published modules only.** It documents what a consumer actually inherits; a module absent from it makes the redistributed footprint unverifiable (state "none beyond …" when it adds no third-party dependency). |

**Independently versioned modules** (today: `tandem-rabbitmq`, plus the Go `tandem-cli`) follow the same
checklist with three changes, because their version is not the library's: they stay **out of `tandem-bom`**,
they stay **in `coveredProjects`** (they are built and tested in this repository like any other module), and
every place that documents them states their version explicitly instead of implying the BOM covers it. Until
such a module's own release workflow exists it also belongs in `notYetPublishedModules` in the root
`build.gradle.kts`, which removes its publishing tasks so a library `v*` tag cannot publish it by accident,
and it stays out of the README's API reference table, whose rows link a javadoc.io page that exists only for
a published artifact.

Unpublished leaf apps (`tandem-sample*`, `tandem-benchmark`) stay out of the BOM and out of coverage
aggregation on purpose: no meaningful coverage, and no `integrationTest` phase for the aggregated report
to depend on.

## Commit messages

- **Describe what changed and why — nothing else.** Three kinds of content stay
  out, and all three are easy to write without noticing:
  - **Implementation detail** — *how* it was done. The diff already says that.
  - **Chronicle** — bugs hit, dead ends tried, debugging steps, what an earlier
    version of the code or doc used to say, which earlier decision this revises.
    That belongs in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-*.md`, the backlog, or a PR
    description.
  - **Commentary** — judging the previous state ("this was wrong", "the earlier
    assessment overreached"), or narrating the reasoning that produced the
    change. State the resulting design as if it had always been so.
- **Write the end result, not the journey, and write it compactly.** A subject
  line, and a body of a few lines at most — often none. The body reports the
  change; it does not justify it, re-state context, or show how the conclusion
  was reached.
- Do **not** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Before every commit, run the full test suite and make sure it is green**
  (`./gradlew test`, or `./gradlew check` to include the coverage gate). Never
  commit with failing or unrun tests.
- **Before every commit, evaluate the coverage of the new or changed code** (JaCoCo —
  e.g. `./gradlew :<module>:jacocoMergedReport`) and read *which* lines and branches
  are uncovered, not just the percentage. Separate **genuine gaps** — untested real
  behaviours: failure/exception paths, reachable edge cases, a branch that has a
  killing input — from **acceptable ones**: defensive guards on framework or
  impossible inputs, and branches no input can kill (per Testing §3, those signal
  code to leave or remove, never a filler test). **Close the trivial genuine gaps
  yourself in the same commit; for the non-trivial ones, surface them to the user
  and ask whether to close them before moving on.** The point is pinned behaviour,
  not a coverage number.
- **Before every commit, check that the docs (`docs/`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  …) are consistent with what is being committed** — update them in the same change
  if the code, conventions, structure, or commands they describe have moved. Treat
  stale docs as part of the diff, not a follow-up.

## Releases

Tags follow `v<semver>` and pushing one publishes all modules to Maven Central.
Before creating a release tag:

1. **Check for breaking changes** since the previous release tag — diff the
   public API surface (`tandem-core` interfaces and public types).
2. If there are breaking changes, **verify the requested version is bumped per
   semantic versioning** (a breaking change requires a major bump; in `0.x`, a
   minor bump conventionally signals it).
3. If the requested version does **not** match what semver requires, do not tag
   silently — ask the user to choose between:
   1. proceed with the version as given,
   2. use the semver-correct version you propose, or
   3. cancel.

The annotated tag's message body becomes the GitHub release notes (the workflow
reads `%(contents:body)`), so write the notes once, in the tag — never by hand on
the release page afterwards. The tag must therefore be **annotated**, never
lightweight. Structure the message:

- **First line** — `tandem v<x.y.z> — <short summary>`. This is the release title;
  everything below it is the body.
- Then only the sections that apply, in this order, each a heading followed by
  `-` bullets: **New**, **Fixes**, **Breaking**, **Known limitations**. Drop a
  section that has nothing in it (an early tag can be title-only).
- **Breaking** is the one never to omit when it applies — name the changed public
  API and what a caller must do. For this library that means the published ports
  and types, the `tandem_*` schema, and the CloudEvents envelope alike (§1.4
  compatibility applies to every contract, not just the API).

Keep the notes short and factual: what changed and why, not how (same rule as
commit messages). Wrap at ~80 columns. Any link must be an **absolute URL** —
release notes render outside the repository, so a relative path does not resolve.
Do not create or push a tag without the user asking in that turn; pushing one
publishes the release and stages the Maven Central deployment.

### `tandem-cli` releases — a separate scheme, not a variant of the above

`tandem-cli` (Go, `tandem-cli/`) is versioned and released **independently of the
library**: tags follow `cli-v<semver>` (e.g. `cli-v0.1.0`), never `v<semver>` — pushing
one runs `.github/workflows/cli-release.yml` (`goreleaser`, cross-compiled binaries
attached to a GitHub Release), not the Maven Central workflow above. `cli-v*` does not
match the library workflow's `v*` trigger and `v*` does not match `cli-v*`, so the two
release paths never fire on each other's tags — no coordination needed between them.

**Why separate:** the CLI's compatibility contract is the Admin API's major version
(`/v1`), not the library's version — a library release that leaves the OpenAPI contract
untouched cannot break the CLI, and the CLI can gain flags or fix bugs with zero library
change. A shared version number would assert a coupling that does not exist
(LLD-cli.md §9.1).

Same annotated-tag-as-release-notes convention applies (first line = title, body =
notes), and the same "ask before tagging" rule. Before tagging a `cli-v*` release, the
breaking-change check is scoped to the CLI's own contract (LLD-cli.md §9.1): command/
subcommand/flag names and semantics, and exit codes — **not** `--output json` payloads
or `human`-mode rendering, which are explicitly outside the CLI's own semver promise.
