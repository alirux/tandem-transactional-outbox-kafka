/**
 * One row of a {@link com.codingful.tandem.core.port.OutboxQuery#search} result — the Admin API's
 * list view. Deliberately narrower than {@link OutboxRecord}: it carries no {@code payload} or
 * {@code headers}, because the list view must not read those columns at all (HLD-admin-api §4). Use
 * {@link com.codingful.tandem.core.port.OutboxQuery#findById} for the full row.
 *
 * <p>{@code correlationId} is the one exception to "no header values in the list view": it is read
 * from its own indexed column, not from {@code headers}, precisely so an incident search can return
 * it without touching the JSONB (HLD-tracing §4). {@code null} for rows written with tracing off.
 *
 * <p>{@code replays} counts operator replays for the lifetime of the row, where {@code attempts} is
 * only the delivery budget of the current round and a replay resets it (HLD §8).
 *
 * <p>{@code seq} is a boxed {@link Long} and is {@code null} for a row written without a sequence
 * number ({@code unsequenced()}, HLD-managed-seq §4.5). A primitive would render that row as
 * {@code 0} — a number that looks authoritative and belongs to no one — which is the same reason
 * {@link OutboxMessage#seq()} throws rather than returning a default.
